        This application helps you forecast project completion based on historical progress.

        optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely scenarios.
    """,

        The PERT factor determines how many data points to use for optimistic and pessimistic estimates.
        A higher value considers more historical data points for calculating scenarios.

        Select how many historical data points to include in your forecast calculation.
