FORECAST_HELP_TEXTS = {
    "pert_methodology": """
        PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) uses three-point estimation for probabilistic forecasting:
        
        📊 **Formula Components:**
        • Optimistic (O): Best-case scenario from top velocity periods
        • Most Likely (ML): Current average velocity from recent data
        • Pessimistic (P): Worst-case scenario from lowest velocity periods
        • Expected (E): Weighted average = (O + 4×ML + P) ÷ 6
        
        🔢 **Mathematical Foundation:**
        The formula weights the Most Likely estimate 4x more heavily than extreme scenarios,
        following beta distribution principles for realistic project estimation.
        
        📈 **Confidence Intervals:**
        Uncertainty range calculated as ±25% of variance between scenarios.
        Wider ranges indicate higher uncertainty; narrower ranges show more predictable velocity.

        Three-point estimation technique provides forecast ranges instead of single points.

        Single estimates ignore uncertainty; ranges acknowledge project variability.
        
        📈 **Confidence Calculation:**
        • Standard Deviation = (Pessimistic - Optimistic) ÷ 6
        • Confidence Interval = Expected ± (Standard Deviation × 1.96) for 95% confidence
        • Practical Range = Expected ± 25% of scenario variance

        • Minimum 3-5 weeks for basic estimates
        • Optimal 6-10 weeks for statistical reliability
        • More data = narrower confidence intervals = higher accuracy
