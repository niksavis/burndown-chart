        This application helps you forecast project completion based on historical progress. 
        It uses the PERT methodology to estimate when your project will be completed based on 
        optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely scenarios.
    """,
    "pert_factor": """
        The PERT factor determines how many data points to use for optimistic and pessimistic estimates.
        A higher value considers more historical data points for calculating scenarios.

        Select how many historical data points to include in your forecast calculation.
        The minimum is 2Ã— your PERT Factor to ensure statistically valid results.
        Using fewer points makes your forecast more responsive to recent trends.
