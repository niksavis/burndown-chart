        PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) uses three-point estimation for probabilistic forecasting:
        
        üìä **Formula Components:**
        ‚Ä¢ Optimistic (O): Best-case scenario from top velocity periods
        ‚Ä¢ Most Likely (ML): Current average velocity from recent data

        The formula weights the Most Likely estimate 4x more heavily than extreme scenarios,
        following beta distribution principles for realistic project estimation.
        
        üìà **Confidence Intervals:**

        Weekly Progress Data table provides comprehensive tracking of team velocity and scope changes.
        
        üìä **Table Structure:**
        Each row represents one week of project activity with key metrics for forecasting.
        
        üî¢ **Column Definitions:**
        
        **Week Start (Monday):**
        ‚Ä¢ Reference date for the work week (Monday-Sunday period)
        ‚Ä¢ Used for chronological sorting and trend analysis
        ‚Ä¢ Should be actual calendar Monday even if team starts different day
        
        **Items Done This Week:**
        ‚Ä¢ Count of work items completed during this specific week
        ‚Ä¢ Must be truly "done" items (passed testing, deployed, delivered)
        ‚Ä¢ Incremental count (not cumulative total)
        ‚Ä¢ Used for velocity trend analysis and PERT calculations
        
        **Points Done This Week:**
        ‚Ä¢ Story points or effort units completed during this specific week
        ‚Ä¢ Should match the estimated effort of items marked done
        ‚Ä¢ Incremental points (not cumulative total)
        ‚Ä¢ More accurate than item count for teams with variable item complexity
        
        **New Items Added:**
        ‚Ä¢ Work items discovered, created, or added to backlog this week
        ‚Ä¢ Includes user stories, bugs, technical debt, scope additions
        ‚Ä¢ Tracks scope growth and requirement discovery patterns
        ‚Ä¢ Used for scope change rate and adaptability calculations
        
        **New Points Added:**
        ‚Ä¢ Estimated effort for newly added work items
        ‚Ä¢ Represents scope impact of new requirements
        ‚Ä¢ Used for throughput ratio and scope stability analysis
        
        üìà **Usage for Forecasting:**
        
        **Velocity Calculations:**
        ‚Ä¢ Average: Sum of "Items/Points Done" √∑ Number of weeks
        ‚Ä¢ Trend analysis: Percentage change between recent periods
        ‚Ä¢ PERT scenarios: Best/worst/typical performance identification
        
        **Scope Analysis:**
        ‚Ä¢ Growth rate: New items/points added vs baseline scope
        ‚Ä¢ Throughput ratio: Created vs completed work comparison
        ‚Ä¢ Adaptability index: Consistency of scope change patterns
        
        **Data Quality Tips:**
        ‚Ä¢ Enter data weekly for accurate trend detection
        ‚Ä¢ Use consistent "done" definition throughout project
        ‚Ä¢ Include all work types (features, bugs, technical tasks)
        ‚Ä¢ Estimate new items promptly for accurate scope tracking
        
        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes:**
        ‚Ä¢ Entering cumulative totals instead of weekly increments
        ‚Ä¢ Inconsistent item/point estimation practices
        ‚Ä¢ Missing weeks creating gaps in trend analysis
        ‚Ä¢ Different "done" definitions across team members

        Comprehensive guide to choosing and interpreting burndown vs burnup charts.
        
        üìâ **Burndown Charts:**
        ‚Ä¢ Show remaining work decreasing over time
        ‚Ä¢ Start high (total scope) and trend toward zero
        ‚Ä¢ Ideal for fixed-scope projects with clear endpoints
        ‚Ä¢ Emphasize completion progress and deadline tracking
        
        üìà **Burnup Charts:**
        ‚Ä¢ Show completed work increasing over time
        ‚Ä¢ Start at zero and trend toward total scope
        ‚Ä¢ Better for agile projects with changing scope
        ‚Ä¢ Emphasize delivery progress and scope changes
        
        üéØ **When to Use Each:**
        
        **Use Burndown When:**
        ‚Ä¢ Fixed scope and deadline (traditional projects)
        ‚Ä¢ Stakeholders focus on "how much is left"
        ‚Ä¢ Clear definition of project completion
        ‚Ä¢ Scope changes are minimal or well-controlled
        
        **Use Burnup When:**
        ‚Ä¢ Agile/iterative development approach
        ‚Ä¢ Scope changes are common and expected
        ‚Ä¢ Focus on delivered value over remaining work
        ‚Ä¢ Need to visualize scope growth alongside delivery
        
        üìä **Visual Elements:**
        ‚Ä¢ Solid lines: Historical actual data
        ‚Ä¢ Dashed lines: PERT forecast projections
        ‚Ä¢ Dotted lines: Confidence intervals and uncertainty ranges

        PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) creates realistic forecasts using three-point estimation.
        
        üî¢ **Three-Point Estimation Process:**
        1. **Optimistic Scenario**: Best-case timeline from peak velocity periods
        2. **Most Likely Scenario**: Realistic estimate from current average velocity
        3. **Pessimistic Scenario**: Worst-case timeline from lowest velocity periods
        4. **Expected Value**: Weighted calculation = (O + 4√óML + P) √∑ 6
        
        üìä **Mathematical Foundation:**
        ‚Ä¢ Follows beta distribution for project estimation
        ‚Ä¢ Weights most likely scenario 4x more than extremes
        ‚Ä¢ Provides statistically sound forecasts with confidence intervals
        ‚Ä¢ Accounts for both optimism bias and risk factors
        
        üìà **Confidence Intervals:**
        ‚Ä¢ Calculated as ¬±25% of variance between optimistic and pessimistic
        ‚Ä¢ Wider intervals indicate higher uncertainty
        ‚Ä¢ Narrower intervals suggest more predictable delivery patterns
        ‚Ä¢ Use for risk planning and stakeholder communication
        
        üéØ **Practical Application:**
        ‚Ä¢ Expected value: Primary planning target
        ‚Ä¢ Optimistic: Best-case scenario for resource planning
        ‚Ä¢ Pessimistic: Risk mitigation and buffer planning
        ‚Ä¢ Confidence bands: Communication of forecast uncertainty
        
        üí° **Accuracy Factors:**
        Forecast accuracy improves with:
        ‚Ä¢ More historical data points (8+ weeks recommended)
        ‚Ä¢ Consistent team composition and working arrangements
        ‚Ä¢ Stable definition of "done" and point estimation
        ‚Ä¢ Regular, complete data collection practices
