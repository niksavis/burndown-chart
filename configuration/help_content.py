        PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) uses three-point estimation for probabilistic forecasting:
        
        üìä **Formula Components:**
        ‚Ä¢ Optimistic (O): Best-case scenario from top velocity periods
        ‚Ä¢ Most Likely (ML): Current average velocity from recent data
        ‚Ä¢ Pessimistic (P): Worst-case scenario from lowest velocity periods
        ‚Ä¢ Expected (E): Weighted average = (O + 4√óML + P) √∑ 6
        
        üî¢ **Mathematical Foundation:**
        The formula weights the Most Likely estimate 4x more heavily than extreme scenarios,
        following beta distribution principles for realistic project estimation.
        
        üìà **Confidence Intervals (Statistical Percentiles):**
        ‚Ä¢ 50% (Median): The PERT forecast itself - 50% chance of completion by this date
        ‚Ä¢ 80% (Good Confidence): PERT + 0.84 standard deviations - 80% chance of completion
        ‚Ä¢ 95% (High Confidence): PERT + 1.65 standard deviations - 95% chance of completion
        
        Wider ranges indicate higher velocity uncertainty; narrower ranges show more predictable delivery.

        Best-case completion estimate based on your highest velocity periods.

        üî¢ **Three-Point Estimation Process:**
        1. **Optimistic Scenario**: Best-case timeline from peak velocity periods
        2. **Most Likely Scenario**: Realistic estimate from current average velocity
        3. **Pessimistic Scenario**: Worst-case timeline from lowest velocity periods
        4. **Expected Value**: Weighted calculation = (O + 4√óML + P) √∑ 6
