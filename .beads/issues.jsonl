Context Menu Actions:\n   - 'Open in Browser' - Opens/focuses http://127.0.0.1:8050 in default browser\n   - 'Quit' - Gracefully shuts down app (sys.exit(0))\n\n3. Implementation Details:\n   - Library: pystray (https://pypi.org/project/pystray/)\n   - Add to requirements.in: pystray\u003e=0.19.5\n   - Tray icon runs in separate daemon thread\n   - Must not block Dash/Waitress server\n   - Icon file: assets/icon.ico (already exists for executable)\n\n4. Files to Modify:\n   - requirements.in - add pystray dependency\n   - app.py - initialize tray icon when running as frozen executable\n   - build/app.spec - ensure icon.ico is bundled (already is)\n\n5. Code Structure:\n   `python\n   if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):  # Only for executable\n       import pystray\n       from PIL import Image\n       \n       def on_open(icon, item):\n           webbrowser.open('http://127.0.0.1:8050')\n       \n       def on_quit(icon, item):\n           icon.stop()\n           sys.exit(0)\n       \n       icon = pystray.Icon('burndown-chart',\n           Image.open('assets/icon.ico'),\n           'Burndown Chart',\n           menu=pystray.Menu(\n               pystray.MenuItem('Open in Browser', on_open),\n               pystray.MenuItem('Quit', on_quit)\n           ))\n       \n       # Run in separate thread\n       threading.Thread(target=icon.run, daemon=True).start()\n   `\n\n6.
