Uses existing database infrastructure (no new dependencies)\n2. Atomic operations with SQLite (no race conditions)\n3. Graceful degradation (falls back to normal launch if flag fails)\n4. One-time flag (auto-cleanup prevents state pollution)\n5.

Implementation Details:\n   - Library: pystray (https://pypi.org/project/pystray/)\n   - Add to requirements.in: pystray\u003e=0.19.5\n   - Tray icon runs in separate daemon thread\n   - Must not block Dash/Waitress server\n   - Icon file: assets/icon.ico (already exists for executable)\n\n4.

{"id":"burndown-chart-rk4","title":"Update mechanism UX improvements: speed, cleanup, silent operation","description":"Comprehensive improvements to the update flow beyond initial implementation:\n\nCOMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n1. App Exit Fix (CRITICAL):\n   - Changed from graceful shutdown (blocking) to os._exit(0)\n   - Allows updater to immediately replace executable files\n   - File: data/update_manager.py\n\n2. Speed Optimizations:\n   - Added psutil for faster process detection (0.1s vs 0.5s polling)\n   - Reduced updater delays: 1s → 0s after process exit, 3s → 1s final window\n   - Faster tasklist polling fallback (0.2s vs 0.5s)\n   - Total improvement: ~2-3 seconds faster update\n   - Files: updater/updater.py, requirements.in\n\n3. Cleanup Improvements:\n   - Remove .bak file after successful update\n   - Remove update ZIP file\n   - Clean up temp directories (burndown_updater, burndown_updates)\n   - File: updater/updater.py\n\n4. Background Download with Progress:\n   - Download runs in background thread (non-blocking UI)\n   - Live progress bar updates via polling (0% → 100%)\n   - Completion toast when download finishes\n   - Files: callbacks/app_update.py, ui/layout.py\n\n5. Footer Fallback Button:\n   - Footer button works at all update stages\n   - Triggers download when AVAILABLE, install when READY\n   - Prevents need to restart app if toast dismissed\n   - Files: callbacks/app_update.py, ui/layout.py\n\n6. Silent Operation (Console-Free):\n   - Changed app.spec: console=True → console=False\n   - Changed updater.spec: console=True → console=False\n   - No terminal windows at any stage\n   - Clean background service like mailhog\n   - All logs still in logs/app.log and logs/errors.log\n   - Files: build/app.spec, build/updater.spec\n\n7. User Guidance:\n   - Toast message tells user to close browser tab\n   - Clear instructions that new tab will open automatically\n   - 30-second toast duration covers entire update process\n   - File: callbacks/app_update.py\n\n8. Browser Handling:\n   - Changed webbrowser.open() to open(url, new=2, autoraise=True)\n   - Attempts to reuse window (browser-dependent)\n   - Auto-launches browser when no browser open\n   - File: app.py\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- data/update_manager.py (exit fix)\n- updater/updater.py (speed, cleanup, psutil)\n- callbacks/app_update.py (background download, progress, toast)\n- ui/layout.py (footer button, progress polling)\n- build/app.spec (console=False)\n- build/updater.spec (console=False)\n- requirements.in (psutil)\n- app.py (browser handling)\n\nREADY FOR TESTING:\nRebuild with: .\\build\\build.ps1 -VerboseBuild\nTest complete update cycle with silent operation\n\nRELATED TASKS:\n- Completes T054 (graceful shutdown delay)\n- Improves T053 (user guidance for disconnection)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"niksavis@live.com","created_at":"2026-01-16T20:14:38.26058+01:00","created_by":"Niksa Visic","updated_at":"2026-01-16T23:32:16.3701659+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T23:32:16.3701659+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
