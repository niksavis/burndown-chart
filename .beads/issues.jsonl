Which query is currently active\n2. When was the data last updated (important for stale data awareness)\n\n## Solution: Compact Relative Timestamp Display\nAdd last update timestamp after [Active] postfix using compact relative format:\n\n**Format**: Query Name [Active] • 2h ago\n\n**Examples**:\n- Last 12 Weeks [Active] • 2h ago\n- Development Sprint • 5d ago\n- Bugs Query [Active] • Just now\n- Old Query • Jan 28\n\n**Relative time ranges**:\n- Just now (\u003c 1 minute)\n- 5m ago (1-59 minutes)\n- 2h ago (1-23 hours)\n- 3d ago (1-6 days)\n- 2w ago (7-28 days)\n- Jan 15 (\u003e28 days, same year)\n- Dec '25 (previous years)\n\n**Timestamp Source**:\n- Use jira_cache.created_at from database\n- Represents START of update operation (when data snapshot begins)\n- Only shown for queries with fetched data (never-fetched queries show no timestamp)\n\n## Implementation Scope\n1. Add get_relative_time_string() helper in data/query_manager.py\n2. Enhance list_queries_with_last_update() to join with jira_cache.created_at\n3. Update dropdown rendering in 13 files (ui/query_selector.py, callbacks/*, etc.)\n4. Add mobile CSS for graceful text wrapping on small screens\n5. Add unit tests for relative time formatting\n\n## Mobile Considerations\n- **Character budget**: ~10-12 chars added per query name\n- **320px screens**: Text wraps gracefully to 2 lines (CSS word-wrap)\n- **Responsive font**: 13px on \u003c375px screens for better fit\n- **Visual separator**: Bullet (•) creates clear hierarchy\n- **No icon fallback needed**: Testing will confirm\n\n## Goals\n- Instant awareness of data freshness\n- Compact display that works on mobile (320px+)\n- Intuitive relative time format\n- No timestamp for never-fetched queries","notes":"Implemented Option 1: Compact relative time display in query dropdowns.

{"id":"burndown-chart-2ub9","title":"Page not auto-refreshing after update - footer and toast only appear after manual refresh","description":"After update from 2.7.16 to 2.7.17, the overlay disappears correctly but the page does NOT auto-refresh. Footer version and success toast only appear after manual browser refresh. Expected: page should auto-refresh or Dash should auto-reconnect and trigger UI updates.","notes":"INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:\n\n**Current Behavior:**\n1. User clicks Update button\n2. Overlay shows 'Reconnecting...'\n3. Update completes, overlay disappears\n4. Page stays on old version (footer still shows v2.7.16)\n5. No success toast shown\n6. Manual refresh → footer updates to v2.7.17 + success toast appears\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n1. User clicks Update button\n2. Overlay shows\n3. Update completes\n4. Overlay disappears\n5. Page auto-refreshes OR Dash auto-reconnects\n6. Footer shows v2.7.17\n7. Success toast displays immediately\n\n**TIMING-DEPENDENT BEHAVIOR (Critical Finding):**\n\nTest 1 - Fast Machine (original report):\n- Toast: NOT shown\n- Footer: NOT updated\n- After manual refresh: Both toast and footer appear\n\nTest 2 - Slow Machine:\n- Toast: SHOWN correctly\n- Footer: NOT updated\n- After manual refresh: Footer updates, toast does NOT show again (correct)\n\n**Analysis:**\nThis confirms a RACE CONDITION between JavaScript DOM manipulation and Dash reconnection:\n- JavaScript tries to update footer + show toast (lines 293-310)\n- Dash websocket reconnects and re-renders components\n- On fast machines: Dash reconnects before JavaScript executes → both fail\n- On slow machines: JavaScript toast succeeds, but Dash still overwrites footer before it can update\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe code removes the overlay (line 293) which allows Dash to begin reconnection. Dash then re-renders the entire page/components, OVERWRITING any JavaScript DOM changes made between overlay removal and full reconnection.\n\nThe JavaScript manipulations (footer update, toast creation) are fighting against Dash's component re-rendering. They only work if executed after Dash finishes reconnecting, which is unpredictable timing.\n\n**Code Location:**\n- assets/update_reconnect.js lines 270-330 (pollServer function, update flow branch)\n- Line 293: hideReconnectingOverlay() removes overlay → TRIGGERS Dash reconnection\n- Line 295-303: Updates footer via DOM manipulation (RACES with Dash re-render)\n- Line 306: Shows toast via DOM manipulation (RACES with Dash re-render)\n- Line 309: Sets isUpdateFlow = false\n- MISSING: No coordination with Dash reconnection state\n\n**Why Manual Refresh Works:**\nManual refresh causes browser to:\n1. Re-request page from server (gets new v2.7.17 HTML)\n2. Re-initialize Dash with new version\n3. Check post_update flag in /api/version (lines 541-577)\n4. Show success toast via init() function (line 569) AFTER Dash initializes\n5. Footer already rendered with correct version in HTML\n\n**Solution Options:**\n\nOption A: Force page reload after overlay removal (simplest, RECOMMENDED)\n- Add window.location.reload() after line 309\n- Pros: Guarantees fresh page load with new version, no race conditions\n- Cons: Full page reload (brief white flash) - but expected after update\n- Implementation: One line change\n\nOption B: Wait for Dash reconnection before DOM updates\n- Monitor Dash's connection state (window.dash_clientside?)\n- Only update footer + show toast AFTER Dash finishes reconnecting\n- Pros: No page reload\n- Cons: Complex, fragile, requires Dash internals knowledge\n\nOption C: Use post_update flag mechanism (current fallback path)\n- Remove all DOM manipulation from update flow (lines 295-310)\n- Let init() function (lines 541-577) handle everything on page load\n- Force reload after overlay removal to trigger init() path\n- Pros: Uses existing reliable code path\n- Cons: Requires page reload anyway\n\n**Recommendation:** Option A (force reload) or Option C (which is essentially Option A + code cleanup). Page reload after update is acceptable UX and eliminates all race conditions. Users EXPECT a 'fresh start' after update.\n\n**Proposed Fix:**\n`javascript\n// Line 293: Remove overlay\nhideReconnectingOverlay();\n\n// IMMEDIATELY force page reload to trigger clean initialization\n// This uses the post_update flag mechanism (lines 541-577)\n// which reliably shows toast + updates footer after Dash initializes\nwindow.location.reload();\n\n// Remove lines 295-310 (DOM manipulation that races with Dash)\n`\n\n**Test Case:**\n1. Start app v2.7.16\n2. Check for updates (should show v2.7.17 available)\n3. Click Update button\n4. Wait for overlay to appear → disappear\n5. VERIFY: Page reloads automatically (brief white flash acceptable)\n6. VERIFY: Footer shows v2.7.17 immediately after reload\n7. VERIFY: Success toast appears immediately after reload\n8. VERIFY: No duplicate toasts or broken state\n9.

If loading takes \u003e1s, show a visually themed spinner at the best UX location.\n\nResearch notes:\n- Current load time can reach 5s on large datasets.\n- Spinner should be non-intrusive, thematically fit the app, and only appear if load \u003e1s.\n- Optimize backend and/or frontend for faster data delivery.\n- Consider async loading, caching, and UI feedback best practices.\n- Do not implement yet; this bead is for future release planning.\n\nReferences: User request 2026-01-27, Copilot research.","notes":"## Investigation: Staggered Loading Issue\n\n### Problem Identified\n1. Spinner works on initial load ✓\n2. NO spinner during updates (slider, query changes) ✗\n3. Page elements load one-by-one (jarring UX) ✗\n\n### Root Cause\nThe render_tab_content callback has **cache optimization** that makes it return almost instantly when data hasn't changed. The callback flow:\n1. User moves slider → triggers callback\n2. Callback checks cache → finds match → returns immediately (\u003c100ms)\n3. 300ms delay prevents spinner from showing\n4. BUT: Plotly charts inside the content render asynchronously afterward\n5. Result: No loading indicator, then charts pop in one by one\n\n### Why dcc.Loading Doesn't Help\n- dcc.Loading only shows during *callback execution*\n- Callback executes instantly (returns cached content)\n- Chart rendering happens *after* callback completes (client-side)\n- Loading component thinks work is done, but charts still rendering\n\n### Potential Solutions\n1. **Reduce delay_show to 100ms** - catch more updates but risk flash\n2. **Add skeleton loaders** - show placeholder charts before Plotly renders\n3. **Disable caching temporarily** - force callback to be slower (bad for perf)\n4. **Client-side loading detection** - detect Plotly render events\n5. **Pre-render charts** - generate chart JSON before returning (slowdown accepted)\n\n### Recommendation\nNeed to balance performance (caching) vs UX (loading indicators). Current caching makes app FAST but loading INVISIBLE.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"niksavis@live.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T08:37:58.3478487+01:00","created_by":"Niksa Visic","updated_at":"2026-01-27T12:45:08.1959608+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T12:45:08.1959608+01:00","close_reason":"Implemented visual feedback via sticky banner icons - purple fade for UI operations, orange spinner for Update Data"}

{"id":"burndown-chart-7rjd","title":"Implement Roadmap/Timeline gantt chart visualization","description":"Create a dedicated Roadmap/Timeline tab with gantt chart visualization for planning and tracking epics and high-level deliverables. This feature enables users to visualize project timelines, track epic progress, and manage milestones separately from sprint-level burndown tracking.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Dedicated tab for roadmap view (separate from sprint burndown)\n- Gantt chart showing epics/initiatives with start and end dates\n- Configurable JIRA issue types (Epic, Initiative, Release, etc.)\n- Flexible date field mapping (target dates, fixVersions, or fallback to created/resolution)\n- Vertical milestone markers at configurable dates\n- Handle ongoing work (no end date = extend to horizon)\n- Separate JQL query configuration from main burndown query\n- Color coding by issue type, status, or project\n- Mobile-first responsive design\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n- Reuse existing field mapping system (similar to DORA/Flow metrics)\n- Leverage SQLite persistence with separate roadmap query namespace\n- Plotly Gantt chart visualization\n- Follow established tab configuration pattern (TAB_CONFIG registry)\n- ~8-12 days implementation effort\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- Product managers tracking epic delivery timelines\n- Release planning with milestone markers\n- Portfolio view of multiple initiatives\n- Stakeholder communication with high-level roadmap\n- Dependency visualization across epics\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- JIRA epics or similar issue types with date fields (or use created/resolved as fallback)\n- Optional: Custom fields for target start/end dates\n- Existing burndown chart profile and JIRA connection","notes":"## Technical Analysis\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\n**Current System Structure:**\n- **Tab System:** TAB_CONFIG registry in ui/tabs.py defines all tabs (currently 7 tabs)\n- **Query Management:** data/query_manager.py handles profile-based queries with SQLite persistence\n- **JIRA API:** data/jira_simple.py with field mapping support via field_mappings config\n- **Database:** SQLite backend (profiles/burndown.db) with 12 tables\n- **Visualization:** Plotly charts in visualization/ package\n- **Tab Navigation:** Mobile + desktop responsive with dbc.Tabs component\n\n### Roadmap/Timeline Requirements Analysis\n\n**1. JIRA Data Requirements:**\n- **Issue Types:** Configurable (Epic, Initiative, Release, etc.)\n- **Date Fields:** \n  - Primary: Target Start/End dates (customfield_XXXXX)\n  - Fallback: created/resolutiondate (standard fields)\n  - Support: fixVersions.releaseDate for version-based roadmaps\n- **Field Mapping:** Leverage existing field_mappings system (FR-006 through FR-010)\n- **Query:** Separate JQL query distinct from current burndown query\n\n**2. Data Model Considerations:**\n- **Unlimited End Dates:** Handle NULL or ongoing items (no resolution date)\n- **Visualization:** Gantt chart needs start date, end date (or current date as proxy)\n- **Milestones:** Vertical lines at configurable dates (similar to deadline markers)\n- **Time Range:** Calculate min/max dates from dataset + configurable padding\n\n**3. UI/UX Design:**\n- **New Tab:** Add to TAB_CONFIG with order=7 (after Weekly Data)\n  - id: 'tab-roadmap' or 'tab-timeline'\n  - icon: 'fa-calendar-alt' or 'fa-road'\n  - requires_data: True\n- **Query Configuration:** Dedicated settings for roadmap JQL query\n- **Date Field Mapping:** UI to map issue type date fields (similar to DORA field mapping)\n- **Milestone Configuration:** Input for milestone dates with labels\n\n**4. Visualization Strategy:**\n- **Library:** Plotly Gantt chart (plotly.figure_factory.create_gantt)\n- **Alternative:** Custom Plotly.graph_objects with horizontal bars\n- **Features Needed:**\n  - Color coding by issue type or status\n  - Hover info: issue key, summary, dates\n  - Vertical milestone lines (similar to add_deadline_marker)\n  - Today marker (vertical line showing current date)\n  - Zoom/pan for long timelines\n  - Ongoing items: extend to current date or future cutoff\n\n**5. Data Flow Pattern:**\n`\nUser configures roadmap query (JQL + issue types + date fields)\n  ↓\nSeparate JIRA API call (fetch_jira_issues with roadmap config)\n  ↓\nStore in SQLite (separate table or query namespace)\n  ↓\nTransform to Gantt format (start_date, end_date, task_name)\n  ↓\nRender Plotly Gantt chart in tab-roadmap content\n  ↓\nAdd milestone overlays (vertical lines)\n`\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Phase 1: Configuration \u0026 Data (3-4 days)**\n- Add roadmap_config to app_settings.json:\n  - roadmap_jql: str (JQL query for roadmap items)\n  - roadmap_issue_types: List[str] (Epic, Initiative, etc.)\n  - roadmap_start_field: str (customfield_XXXXX or 'created')\n  - roadmap_end_field: str (customfield_XXXXX or 'resolutiondate')\n  - roadmap_milestones: List[{date: str, label: str}]\n- Update data/query_manager.py to support roadmap query type\n- Create data/roadmap_fetcher.py for JIRA data retrieval\n- Add SQLite table or use existing jira_issues with roadmap query_id\n\n**Phase 2: Visualization (2-3 days)**\n- Create visualization/roadmap_chart.py\n- Implement create_roadmap_gantt_chart():\n  - Transform JIRA issues to Gantt format\n  - Handle unlimited end dates (use today or max_date)\n  - Add milestone vertical lines\n  - Color code by issue type/status\n- Handle edge cases (single-day items, overlapping items)\n\n**Phase 3: UI Integration (2-3 days)**\n- Add tab to TAB_CONFIG in ui/tabs.py\n- Create ui/roadmap_tab.py for layout\n- Create callbacks/roadmap.py for data updates\n- Add roadmap settings to settings panel (accordion or tab)\n- Mobile-first responsive design\n\n**Phase 4: Testing \u0026 Polish (1-2 days)**\n- Unit tests for Gantt chart generation\n- Integration tests for JIRA data fetch\n- Edge case testing (no data, all ongoing, etc.)\n- Performance testing (100+ items)\n\n### Technical Challenges \u0026 Solutions\n\n**Challenge 1: Unlimited End Dates**\n- **Solution:** Use today + configurable horizon (e.g., 6 months) or max(all_end_dates) + buffer\n\n**Challenge 2: Separate Query Management**\n- **Solution:** Reuse existing query_manager.py pattern, add roadmap query type\n\n**Challenge 3: Gantt Chart Performance**\n- **Solution:** Limit to 200 items, provide filtering by issue type/project\n\n**Challenge 4: Date Field Flexibility**\n- **Solution:** Field mapping UI similar to DORA/Flow metrics (callbacks/field_mapping.py pattern)\n\n### Files to Modify/Create\n\n**New Files:**\n- data/roadmap_fetcher.py (JIRA query + transform)\n- visualization/roadmap_chart.py (Gantt chart generation)\n- ui/roadmap_tab.py (tab layout)\n- callbacks/roadmap.py (callbacks for data updates)\n- tests/unit/visualization/test_roadmap_chart.py\n- tests/unit/callbacks/test_roadmap.py\n\n**Modified Files:**\n- ui/tabs.py (add TAB_CONFIG entry)\n- configuration/settings.py (add roadmap help texts)\n- data/persistence/sqlite_backend.py (if new table needed)\n- ui/improved_settings_panel.py (add roadmap settings)\n- callbacks/__init__.py (register roadmap callbacks)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n**Existing Patterns to Reuse:**\n- Field mapping: callbacks/field_mapping.py, data/field_mapper.py\n- Query management: data/query_manager.py\n- Deadline markers: visualization/charts.py::add_deadline_marker()\n- Tab structure: ui/tabs.py::TAB_CONFIG\n- Mobile navigation: ui/mobile_navigation.py\n\n**External Libraries:**\n- plotly (already used): Gantt chart support\n- No new dependencies required\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] User can configure separate JQL query for roadmap\n- [ ] User can map issue type date fields (start/end)\n- [ ] Gantt chart displays with correct timeline\n- [ ] Unlimited end dates handled gracefully\n- [ ] Milestone lines appear at configured dates\n- [ ] Responsive on mobile and desktop\n- [ ] Performance \u003c2s for 100 items\n- [ ] Works with standard JIRA fields (fallback to created/resolutiondate)\n\n### Research Recommendations\n\n1. **Plotly Gantt API:** Test plotly.figure_factory.create_gantt vs custom bars\n2. **Apache Kafka JIRA:** Check if Epics have target start/end custom fields\n3. **Field Detection:** Can field_detector.py auto-detect date fields in Epics?\n4. **User Preferences:** Survey users on preferred name: Roadmap vs Timeline\n5. **Date Horizon:** Research common roadmap time ranges (3/6/12 months?)\n\n### Estimated Effort\n\n- **Total:** 8-12 days (64-96 hours)\n- **Phase 1:** 3-4 days\n- **Phase 2:** 2-3 days\n- **Phase 3:** 2-3 days\n- **Phase 4:** 1-2 days\n\n**Complexity:** Medium-High (requires coordination across multiple layers)\n**Risk:** Low (reuses existing patterns extensively)\n\n\n\n## Interactive Roadmap Requirements (User-Editable Gantt Chart)\n\n### Updated Feature Scope\n\n**CRITICAL CHANGE:** Roadmap must be fully interactive with drag-and-drop editing capabilities, NOT static Plotly visualization.\n\n**User Interactions Required:**\n1. **Drag Blocks Vertically:** Reorder items in timeline\n2. **Drag Blocks Horizontally:** Change start/end dates\n3. **Resize Blocks:** Adjust target start/end dates by dragging edges\n4. **Edit Names:** Click to edit issue summary text inline\n5. **Local Persistence:** All changes saved to SQLite, NEVER synced to JIRA\n6. **Override Warning:** Re-fetching JIRA data will overwrite local changes\n\n### Interactive Timeline Library Options\n\n**Option 1: vis-timeline (Recommended)**\n- **Library:** vis-timeline (formerly vis.js timeline)\n- **npm:** vis-timeline (MIT license)\n- **Features:** Full drag-and-drop, resize, edit, zoom, pan\n- **Dash Integration:** Custom Dash component wrapper or iframe + clientside callbacks\n- **Data Format:** JSON timeline items with start/end dates\n- **Pros:** Battle-tested, feature-complete, great documentation\n- **Cons:** Requires custom Dash component or iframe integration\n- **Example:** https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/\n\n**Option 2: react-beautiful-dnd + Custom Timeline**\n- **Library:** react-beautiful-dnd (Atlassian)\n- **npm:** react-beautiful-dnd\n- **Features:** Smooth drag-and-drop, accessibility\n- **Dash Integration:** Create custom Dash component with React\n- **Pros:** React-based (Dash uses React), smooth animations\n- **Cons:** Requires custom timeline rendering logic\n- **Complexity:** High (custom timeline implementation)\n\n**Option 3: FullCalendar Timeline View**\n- **Library:** FullCalendar (premium timeline addon)\n- **License:** Commercial license required for timeline\n- **Features:** Professional timeline with resource management\n- **Dash Integration:** iframe or custom component\n- **Pros:** Professional, feature-rich\n- **Cons:** Paid license, heavyweight\n\n**Option 4: dhtmlxGantt**\n- **Library:** dhtmlxGantt\n- **License:** GPL (free) or Commercial\n- **Features:** Full gantt chart with dependencies, editing\n- **Dash Integration:** iframe or custom component\n- **Pros:** Purpose-built for gantt charts\n- **Cons:** License complexity, large library\n\n**RECOMMENDATION: vis-timeline (Option 1)**\n- Open source (MIT)\n- Perfect feature match (drag, resize, edit)\n- Proven in production\n- Integration: Custom Dash component or iframe + postMessage\n\n### Integration Architecture: vis-timeline + Dash\n\n**Approach A: Custom Dash Component (Recommended)**\n- Create custom React component wrapping vis-timeline\n- Package as Dash component library\n- Full Dash integration with callbacks\n- **Effort:** 3-4 days for component development\n- **Reference:** dash-bootstrap-components pattern\n\n**Approach B: iframe + postMessage (Faster)**\n- Serve vis-timeline in iframe (separate HTML)\n- Use postMessage for JS ↔ Dash communication\n- Clientside callbacks to sync data\n- **Effort:** 1-2 days for prototype\n- **Trade-off:** Less elegant but faster to implement\n\n**Approach C: Dash Mantine Components Timeline (Alternative)**\n- **Library:** dash-mantine-components (has Timeline component)\n- **Limitation:** Timeline is display-only, not drag-and-drop gantt\n- **Verdict:** Not suitable for roadmap requirements\n\n### Data Flow: Two-Layer Persistence\n\n**Layer 1: JIRA Source of Truth (Read-Only)**\n`\nJIRA API → SQLite jira_issues table\n- Original issue data from JIRA\n- Fields: issue_key, summary, start_date, end_date, issue_type, status\n- Re-fetch overwrites this layer\n`\n\n**Layer 2: Local Overrides (User Edits)**\n`\nUser Edits → SQLite roadmap_overrides table\n- Tracks local modifications\n- Fields: issue_key, custom_summary, custom_start_date, custom_end_date, custom_order\n- Persists across sessions\n- NEVER synced to JIRA\n`\n\n**Merge Logic (Display):**\n`python\ndef get_roadmap_items():\n    jira_items = backend.get_roadmap_issues()  # From jira_issues\n    overrides = backend.get_roadmap_overrides()  # From roadmap_overrides\n    \n    for item in jira_items:\n        if item['key'] in overrides:\n            # Apply local overrides\n            item['summary'] = overrides[item['key']].get('custom_summary', item['summary'])\n            item['start_date'] = overrides[item['key']].get('custom_start_date', item['start_date'])\n            item['end_date'] = overrides[item['key']].get('custom_end_date', item['end_date'])\n            item['order'] = overrides[item['key']].get('custom_order', item['order'])\n    \n    return sorted(jira_items, key=lambda x: x['order'])\n`\n\n### Database Schema (New Table)\n\n`sql\nCREATE TABLE roadmap_overrides (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    profile_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n    query_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n    issue_key TEXT NOT NULL,\n    custom_summary TEXT,\n    custom_start_date TEXT,  -- ISO8601 format\n    custom_end_date TEXT,\n    custom_order INTEGER,\n    modified_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n    UNIQUE(profile_id, query_id, issue_key)\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_roadmap_overrides_lookup \nON roadmap_overrides(profile_id, query_id);\n`\n\n### Clientside Callback Architecture\n\n**Pattern:** Use clientside callbacks for real-time UI updates, server callbacks for persistence\n\n`javascript\n// Clientside: Handle drag events (instant UI feedback)\nwindow.dash_clientside.roadmap = {\n    onItemDrag: function(timelineEvents) {\n        // Update UI immediately\n        // Return new item positions for dcc.Store\n        return {\n            'dragging': true,\n            'items': updatedItems\n        };\n    },\n    \n    onItemResize: function(timelineEvents) {\n        // Update dates immediately\n        return {\n            'resizing': true,\n            'items': updatedItems\n        };\n    }\n};\n`\n\n`python\n# Server: Persist changes to SQLite\n@callback(\n    Output('roadmap-save-status', 'data'),\n    Input('roadmap-items-store', 'data'),\n    prevent_initial_call=True\n)\ndef save_roadmap_changes(items):\n    backend.save_roadmap_overrides(items)\n    return {'saved': True, 'timestamp': datetime.now()}\n`\n\n### Override Warning System\n\n**UI Component:** Banner at top of roadmap tab\n`python\ndbc.Alert([\n    html.I(className='fas fa-exclamation-triangle me-2'),\n    'Local edits active. Re-fetching JIRA data will overwrite your changes.',\n    dbc.Button('Clear Overrides', id='clear-overrides-btn', size='sm', className='ms-2')\n], color='warning', id='roadmap-override-warning', dismissible=False)\n`\n\n**Behavior:**\n- Show when \roadmap_overrides table has records for active profile/query\n- Hide when no overrides exist\n- 'Clear Overrides' button deletes all overrides for current profile/query\n\n### Technical Challenges \u0026 Solutions (Updated)\n\n**Challenge 1: Dash ↔ JavaScript Integration**\n- **Solution A (Recommended):** Custom Dash component wrapping vis-timeline\n  - Create React component following dash-component-boilerplate\n  - Package as dash-vis-timeline library\n  - Full Dash callback integration\n  - **Effort:** 3-4 days\n  - **Reference:** https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate\n\n- **Solution B (Faster Prototype):** iframe + postMessage\n  - Serve vis-timeline.html as static asset\n  - Use dcc.Iframe to embed\n  - Clientside callbacks + postMessage for communication\n  - **Effort:** 1-2 days\n  - **Trade-off:** Less elegant, harder to style consistently\n\n**Challenge 2: Real-Time UI Updates Without Server Round-Trip**\n- **Solution:** Clientside callbacks for drag/resize events\n  - JavaScript handles immediate UI feedback\n  - Debounced server callback for persistence (save after 1s idle)\n  - Pattern: dcc.Store intermediate → debounce → server save\n\n**Challenge 3: JIRA Re-Fetch Override Conflict**\n- **Solution:** Three-way merge strategy\n  - Fetch new JIRA data\n  - Load local overrides\n  - Detect conflicts (deleted issues, renamed issues)\n  - Show conflict resolution modal with options:\n    a) Keep local changes\n    b) Discard local changes\n    c) Merge (use JIRA data for new fields, keep local edits)\n\n**Challenge 4: Performance with 100+ Timeline Items**\n- **Solution:** vis-timeline built-in virtualization\n  - Only renders visible items\n  - Handles 1000+ items efficiently\n  - Add filtering (by project, issue type, status)\n\n### Files to Create/Modify (Updated)\n\n**New Files:**\n- **data/roadmap_fetcher.py** - JIRA query + merge with overrides\n- **data/roadmap_overrides.py** - Override CRUD operations\n- **visualization/roadmap_timeline.py** - vis-timeline integration (if custom component)\n- **ui/roadmap_tab.py** - Tab layout with timeline container\n- **callbacks/roadmap.py** - Server callbacks for persistence\n- **callbacks/roadmap_clientside.py** - Clientside callback registrations\n- **assets/roadmap_timeline.js** - vis-timeline initialization + postMessage bridge\n- **assets/roadmap_timeline.html** - Standalone timeline (if iframe approach)\n- **assets/vis-timeline.min.js** - vis-timeline library (vendor)\n- **assets/vis-timeline.min.css** - vis-timeline styles (vendor)\n- **tests/unit/data/test_roadmap_overrides.py**\n- **tests/unit/callbacks/test_roadmap.py**\n\n**Modified Files:**\n- **data/persistence/sqlite_backend.py** - Add roadmap_overrides table + CRUD\n- **ui/tabs.py** - Add TAB_CONFIG entry for roadmap\n- **configuration/settings.py** - Add roadmap help texts\n- **ui/improved_settings_panel.py** - Add roadmap query configuration\n- **callbacks/__init__.py** - Register roadmap callbacks\n\n**SQL Migration:**\n- **migrations/add_roadmap_overrides_table.sql** - Create roadmap_overrides table\n\n### Estimated Effort (Revised)\n\n**With Custom Dash Component (Recommended):**\n- **Phase 0: Component Development:** 3-4 days (dash-vis-timeline wrapper)\n- **Phase 1: Configuration \u0026 Data:** 3-4 days (override persistence, merge logic)\n- **Phase 2: Integration:** 2-3 days (callbacks, clientside JS)\n- **Phase 3: UI \u0026 Testing:** 2-3 days (tab layout, override warning, tests)\n- **Total:** 10-14 days (80-112 hours)\n\n**With iframe Approach (Faster Prototype):**\n- **Phase 1: Configuration \u0026 Data:** 3-4 days\n- **Phase 2: iframe Integration:** 1-2 days (static HTML + postMessage)\n- **Phase 3: UI \u0026 Testing:** 2-3 days\n- **Total:** 6-9 days (48-72 hours)\n\n**Complexity:** High (custom component or iframe + complex data sync)\n**Risk:** Medium (depends on Dash ↔ JavaScript integration approach)\n\n### Success Criteria (Updated)\n\n- [ ] User can drag timeline blocks vertically to reorder\n- [ ] User can drag timeline blocks horizontally to change dates\n- [ ] User can resize blocks by dragging edges\n- [ ] User can click to edit issue summary inline\n- [ ] All edits persist to SQLite roadmap_overrides table\n- [ ] Edits survive page refresh and app restart\n- [ ] Override warning banner shows when local edits exist\n- [ ] Re-fetching JIRA data overwrites with clear warning\n- [ ] Clear Overrides button removes all local changes\n- [ ] Performance \u003c2s for 100 items\n- [ ] Responsive on desktop (mobile not required for roadmap)\n\n### Research Tasks (Updated)\n\n1. **vis-timeline Integration POC:** Create minimal Dash app with vis-timeline iframe\n2. **Custom Component Feasibility:** Investigate dash-component-boilerplate for React wrapper\n3. **postMessage Protocol:** Design message format for timeline ↔ Dash communication\n4. **Override Conflict UI:** Design modal for JIRA re-fetch conflict resolution\n5. **Performance Testing:** Test vis-timeline with 500+ items in browser\n\n### Alternative: Dash AG Grid Gantt View\n\n**Note:** dash-ag-grid (v31.0.0+) supports gantt chart rendering but is primarily for tabular data with timeline view, not drag-and-drop scheduling. Not suitable for interactive roadmap.\n\n### Recommendation Summary\n\n**For MVP:** Use **iframe + vis-timeline + postMessage** approach (6-9 days)\n- Faster to implement\n- Proven library with all required features\n- Can migrate to custom component later if needed\n\n**For Production:** Create **custom dash-vis-timeline component** (10-14 days)\n- Better Dash integration\n- Consistent styling\n- Full callback support\n- Reusable for future projects\n\n\n\n## fixVersions Support (Additional Date Source)\n\nJIRA fixVersions provide structured release planning data with built-in date fields:\n\n**fixVersions Data Structure:**\n- fixVersions.name: Release name (e.g., 'v2.1.0', 'Q1 2026')\n- fixVersions.startDate: Planned release start date (ISO8601)\n- fixVersions.releaseDate: Target release date (ISO8601)\n- fixVersions.released: Boolean flag (completed releases)\n- fixVersions.archived: Boolean flag (historical releases)\n\n**Integration Strategy:**\n1. Primary Data Source: Use fixVersions dates when available\n2. Fallback Hierarchy:\n   - fixVersions.startDate/releaseDate (preferred)\n   - Custom target date fields (customfield_XXXXX)\n   - Created/resolutionDate (last resort)\n\n**Roadmap Display Logic:**\n- Issue with fixVersions → Use fixVersion start/release dates as timeline block\n- Multiple fixVersions → Show as separate timeline blocks OR merge date range\n- No fixVersions → Fall back to custom fields or created/resolved dates\n\n**Database Schema Update:**\nAdd to roadmap_overrides table:\n- fix_version_name TEXT (track which version is overridden)\n- original_start_date TEXT (preserve JIRA original for conflict detection)\n- original_end_date TEXT (preserve JIRA original for conflict detection)\n\n**UI Enhancements:**\n- Display fixVersion badge on timeline blocks\n- Filter by fixVersion (show only items in specific release)\n- Color code by fixVersion (different releases = different colors)\n- Release milestone markers (vertical lines at fixVersion.releaseDate)\n\n**Example JIRA Query:**\n`jql\nproject = MYPROJ AND fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() ORDER BY fixVersion ASC\n`\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Aligns with JIRA's native release planning\n- No custom field configuration needed\n- Automatic release grouping\n- Built-in release status (released/unreleased)\n\n**Impact on Sub-Tasks:**\n- Task 2 (Database): Add fixVersion fields to schema\n- Task 3 (Data Layer): Implement fixVersion date extraction and fallback logic\n- Task 4 (Integration): Display fixVersion badges on timeline items\n- Task 5 (UI): Add fixVersion filter and release milestone configuration\n\n## REFINED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS - See roadmap_analysis_refined.md\n\n**Analysis Date**: 2026-01-29\n**Key Finding**: 80-90% infrastructure reuse possible\n\n**Major Reuse Opportunities**:\n1. JIRA data fetching (100% reuse - fetch_jira_issues)\n2. fixVersions handling (100% reuse - fixversion_matcher.py + DORA metrics)\n3. Date field detection (90% reuse - field_detector.py)\n4. Field mapping UI (95% reuse - field_mapping_modal.py)\n5. Query management (100% reuse - query_manager.py + SQLite backend)\n\n**Effort Reduction**:\n- Original estimate: 8-12 days\n- Refined estimate: 6-9 days (25-33% reduction)\n- Primary new work: vis-timeline integration (iframe + postMessage)\n\n**Implementation Strategy**:\n- Use existing fetch_jira_issues() with roadmap-specific query\n- Reuse fixversion_matcher.py for fixVersions.releaseDate extraction\n- Follow Bug Analysis tab pattern for conditional display\n- Add roadmap_overrides table for local edit persistence\n- Integrate vis-timeline via iframe + postMessage (MVP approach)\n\n**Files Modified/Created**:\n- New: 6 files (~680 lines total)\n- Modified: 8 files (~217 lines added)\n- Reuse: 80-90% of core infrastructure\n\n**Detailed analysis document**: roadmap_analysis_refined.md (9-page technical breakdown)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"niksavis@live.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T16:00:47.3597752+01:00","created_by":"Niksa Visic","updated_at":"2026-02-03T17:05:39.6645233+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-03T17:05:39.6645233+01:00","close_reason":"Replaced by simpler Active Work Timeline feature (burndown-chart-s530).

Created data/query_manager.py helper (lines 195-285)\n   - get_query_dropdown_options(): Builds dropdown options with timestamps\n   - Queries: SELECT fetched_at FROM jira_issues WHERE profile_id=? AND query_id=? ORDER BY fetched_at DESC LIMIT 1\n   - Format: 'Query Name [Active] (2h ago)' or 'Query Name (2h ago)'\n\n3. Replaced 8 dropdown-building patterns with get_query_dropdown_options():\n   - callbacks/query_management.py (3 locations: lines 361-366, 487-491, 600-604)\n   - callbacks/query_switching.py (4 locations: lines 85-108, 111-122, 217-220, 636)\n   - callbacks/progress_bar.py (1 location: lines 500-509)\n\n4. Fixed timezone bug in data/persistence/sqlite_backend.py (line 751)\n   - Changed: datetime.now().isoformat() → datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()\n   - Issue: Database saved local time, display used UTC, created 50-min offset\n   - Result: All timestamps appeared 'in the future', always showed 'Just now'\n\n5. Fixed delta fetch not updating database timestamps (data/jira_simple.py)\n   - Added cache_jira_response() calls after successful delta fetch in 4 locations:\n     * Line 922-935: Count unchanged scenario\n     * Line 937-951: Small count change scenario  \n     * Line 953-967: Count check failed scenario\n     * Line 893-904: Two-phase fetch scenario\n   - Issue: Delta fetch only updated JSON cache timestamp, not database fetched_at\n   - Result: Timestamp stayed old even after clicking Update Data (if no issues changed)\n\nTESTING REQUIRED:\n1. Click 'Update Data' to fetch issues with corrected UTC timestamps\n2. Wait 2 minutes, refresh page → should show '2m ago' instead of 'Just now'\n3. Verify timestamp ages correctly: 5m ago → 30m ago → 2h ago → etc.\n4. Test both scenarios:\n   - Data changed: Timestamp updates\n   - No data changed: Timestamp STILL updates (shows 'last checked', not 'last changed')\n\nREMAINING WORK:\n- Test with real data to verify timestamp display works correctly\n- Database contains old local-time timestamps until fresh Update Data click\n- Consider cleanup: Remove jira_cache table (bead burndown-chart-qbf5 already created)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"niksavis@live.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T01:46:34.4118263+01:00","created_by":"Niksa Visic","updated_at":"2026-01-29T01:48:25.9646914+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T01:48:25.9646914+01:00","close_reason":"Implemented timestamp feature.

System Tray Icon:\n   - Appears in Windows system tray when app runs\n   - Uses app icon (assets/icon.ico)\n   - Shows on hover: 'Burndown Chart - Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050'\n\n2. Context Menu Actions:\n   - 'Open in Browser' - Opens/focuses http://127.0.0.1:8050 in default browser\n   - 'Quit' - Gracefully shuts down app (sys.exit(0))\n\n3. Implementation Details:\n   - Library: pystray (https://pypi.org/project/pystray/)\n   - Add to requirements.in: pystray\u003e=0.19.5\n   - Tray icon runs in separate daemon thread\n   - Must not block Dash/Waitress server\n   - Icon file: assets/icon.ico (already exists for executable)\n\n4. Files to Modify:\n   - requirements.in - add pystray dependency\n   - app.py - initialize tray icon when running as frozen executable\n   - build/app.spec - ensure icon.ico is bundled (already is)\n\n5. Code Structure:\n   `python\n   if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):  # Only for executable\n       import pystray\n       from PIL import Image\n       \n       def on_open(icon, item):\n           webbrowser.open('http://127.0.0.1:8050')\n       \n       def on_quit(icon, item):\n           icon.stop()\n           sys.exit(0)\n       \n       icon = pystray.Icon('burndown-chart',\n           Image.open('assets/icon.ico'),\n           'Burndown Chart',\n           menu=pystray.Menu(\n               pystray.MenuItem('Open in Browser', on_open),\n               pystray.MenuItem('Quit', on_quit)\n           ))\n       \n       # Run in separate thread\n       threading.Thread(target=icon.run, daemon=True).start()\n   `\n\n6.

{"id":"burndown-chart-wowu","title":"Optimize toast message styling to reduce size and prevent header wrapping","description":"**Problem**: Toast message headers often wrap to 2 lines, making toasts unnecessarily large due to empty space and oversized text.\n\n**Goals**:\n- Reduce font size in toast messages (both header and body)\n- Reduce unused empty space/padding inside toasts\n- Increase toast width by ~20px to prevent header wrapping\n- Keep position fixed at top-right corner of screen\n\n**Reason**: Current toasts take up too much vertical space when headers wrap, reducing screen real estate and looking cluttered.\n\n**Implementation**: Adjust CSS in prevent_credentials_popup.css or custom.css for .toast elements.","notes":"## Technical Analysis\n\n### Current Implementation\n\n#### 1. Toast Component Structure\n- File: ui/toast_notifications.py (lines 24-132)\n- Function: create_toast() - Creates dbc.Toast components\n- Default minWidth: 280px (hardcoded inline style, line 131)\n- Content structure: Icon + message wrapped in html.Div\n\n#### 2. Toast Container Location\n- File: ui/layout.py (lines 141-149)\n- Container ID: 'app-notifications'\n- Position: Fixed at top: 5px, right: 5px\n- Width: 350px (container width)\n- Z-index: 9999 (highest layer)\n\n#### 3. Current CSS Styling\n- File: assets/custom.css (lines 5867-5888)\n- Toast header: padding: var(--space-3) = 1.5rem = 24px\n- Toast body: padding: var(--space-3) = 1.5rem = 24px\n- Toast header font: font-weight: var(--font-semibold) = 600\n- Toast body font: font-size: var(--text-sm) = 0.875rem = 14px\n- Border radius: var(--radius-lg) = 0.5rem = 8px\n- Shadow: var(--shadow-lg)\n\n#### 4. Design System Variables (custom.css lines 1-200)\n- --space-3: 1.5rem (24px) - Current padding\n- --space-2: 1rem (16px) - Smaller padding option\n- --space-1: 0.5rem (8px) - Minimal padding option\n- --text-sm: 0.875rem (14px) - Body text (already used)\n- --text-xs: 0.75rem (12px) - Smaller text option\n- --font-semibold: 600 - Current header weight\n- --font-medium: 500 - Lighter weight option\n\n### Proposed Changes (Non-Breaking)\n\n#### 1. Reduce Padding\n**Target**: .toast-header and .toast-body\n- Change from: padding: var(--space-3) [24px]\n- Change to: padding: var(--space-2) [16px] OR padding: var(--space-1) var(--space-2) [8px 16px]\n- Impact: Reduces vertical space by ~16-32px per toast\n\n#### 2. Reduce Font Sizes\n**Target**: .toast-header\n- Add: font-size: var(--text-sm) [14px] (currently inherits larger size)\n- Keep font-weight: var(--font-semibold) for emphasis\n**Target**: .toast-body (already 14px)\n- Optional: font-size: var(--text-xs) [12px] for more compact body\n\n#### 3. Increase Toast Width\n**Target**: ui/toast_notifications.py line 131\n- Change from: minWidth: '280px'\n- Change to: minWidth: '300px' (~20px increase as requested)\n**Alternative**: Adjust container width in ui/layout.py line 148\n- Change from: width: '350px'\n- Change to: width: '370px'\n\n#### 4. Header Wrapping Prevention\n- Increasing minWidth by 20px should reduce wrapping for most headers\n- Alternative: Add CSS max-width and text-overflow: ellipsis for extremely long headers\n- Keep position: fixed, top: 5px, right: 5px (as requested)\n\n### Implementation Files\n1. assets/custom.css (lines 5874-5888) - Padding and font size changes\n2. ui/toast_notifications.py (line 131) - minWidth inline style\n3. Optional: ui/layout.py (line 148) - Container width adjustment\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Low Risk**: CSS padding/font changes (easily reversible)\n- **Very Low Risk**: Width adjustments (only affects toast container)\n- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing toast calls continue to work\n- **Backward Compatible**: Design system variables ensure consistency","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"niksavis@live.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T20:00:36.9831106+01:00","created_by":"Niksa Visic","updated_at":"2026-01-27T13:27:17.1241545+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T10:52:27.3205541+01:00","labels":["enhancement","toast","ui"]}

Open Configure JIRA Mappings modal \u003e Status tab\n2. Remove a status from 'Active' or 'WIP' lists (e.g., remove 'In Review')\n3. Click 'Save Mappings' (green toast confirms save)\n4. Click 'Update Data' button\n5. Check Flow Efficiency or Flow Load metric\n6. ACTUAL: Metric value unchanged (e.g., Flow Load still 23)\n7. EXPECTED: Metric recalculated with new mappings\n\nTECHNICAL FINDINGS:\n- Status mappings ARE saved correctly to database (verified)\n- calculate_flow_efficiency() and calculate_flow_load() DO read from database dynamically (no hardcoding)\n- ROOT CAUSE: Metrics cache optimization in data/metrics_calculator.py lines 124-147\n- When metrics exist for historical weeks, system returns cached values WITHOUT checking if configuration changed\n- New mappings never applied because recalculation is skipped\n\nIMPACT:\n- Critical UX bug: Users cannot adjust Flow metrics calculations\n- Configuration changes appear to be ignored\n- No way to see effect of status mapping changes without manual cache clearing\n\nSOLUTION:\nOption 1: Invalidate metrics cache when status mappings change (save_field_mappings callback)\nOption 2: Add 'Recalculate Metrics' button that forces full recalculation ignoring cache\nOption 3: Store config hash with each snapshot, recalculate if hash changed","notes":"COMPLETE FIX:\n\n1. Root cause: In-memory snapshots cache not cleared on config save\n   - Added clear_snapshots_cache() call after backend.delete_metrics()\n   \n2. UI reactivity: Metrics tabs didn't auto-update after save\n   - Added metrics-refresh-trigger output to save_or_validate_mappings callback\n   - Returns time.time() timestamp on successful save\n   - Triggers Flow/DORA metrics callbacks to refresh immediately\n   \nRESULT: When user clicks 'Save Mappings':\n1. Validates and saves config\n2. Deletes metrics_data_points rows from database\n3. Clears _snapshots_cache in-memory\n4. Updates metrics-refresh-trigger store with timestamp\n5. Flow/DORA tabs immediately show 'No Metrics' state (empty state component)\n6. User clicks 'Update Data' → recalculates with new config → displays updated metrics\n\nBEHAVIOR MATCHES: Same UX as 'Update Data' button - metrics tabs react immediately.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"niksavis@live.com","created_at":"2026-01-22T11:28:11.253003+01:00","created_by":"Niksa Visic","updated_at":"2026-01-22T12:52:02.0099953+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-22T12:52:02.0099953+01:00","close_reason":"Fixed: Flow metrics now update immediately when status mappings saved.
