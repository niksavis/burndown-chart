"""Project filtering utilities for multi-project Jira setups.

This module provides functions to filter issues based on project type (Development vs DevOps)
to ensure metrics are calculated correctly across multiple projects.

Architecture:
- Single JQL query fetches issues from multiple projects (e.g., DEV1, DEV2, OPS)
- Projects are classified as either "Development" or "DevOps"
- Metrics filter issues based on their purpose:
  * Burndown/Velocity: Development projects only (exclude DevOps)
  * DORA Deployments: DevOps projects only (Operational Tasks)
  * DORA Incidents: Development projects only (Bugs)
  * Flow Metrics: Development projects only (Stories, Tasks)
