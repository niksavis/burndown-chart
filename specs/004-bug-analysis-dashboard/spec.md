# Feature Specification: Bug Analysis Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `004-bug-analysis-dashboard`  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add Bug Analysis Dashboard with issue type distinction, bug metrics visualization, timeline trends, and actionable quality insights"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Bug Metrics Overview (Priority: P1)

As a project manager, I want to see an overview of all bug metrics for my project so that I can quickly assess the quality status and identify if there are quality concerns requiring immediate attention.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of bug analysis - users need to see the overall bug landscape before diving into details. Without this view, users cannot assess their quality situation or make informed decisions about resource allocation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading bug data from JIRA and verifying that the dashboard displays total bugs, open bugs, closed bugs, and bug resolution rate. Delivers immediate value by showing quality status at a glance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have JIRA data with Bug issue types, **When** I navigate to the Bug Analysis tab, **Then** I see a summary card showing total bugs, open bugs, closed bugs, and bug resolution percentage
2. **Given** I have selected a specific timeline filter, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** all bug metrics reflect only bugs within the selected timeline
3. **Given** there are no bugs in the selected timeline, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** I see a message indicating "No bugs found in selected period" with zero values displayed
4. **Given** my JIRA data has multiple issue types (Story, Bug, Task), **When** the dashboard analyzes the data, **Then** only issues with type "Bug" are included in bug metrics

### User Story 2 - Track Bug Creation and Resolution Trends (Priority: P1)

As a team lead, I want to visualize bug creation and closure trends over time so that I can identify periods of high bug creation and assess whether my team is resolving bugs faster than new ones are being created.

**Why this priority**: Understanding whether bugs are accumulating or being resolved is critical for quality management. This directly impacts release decisions and team capacity planning.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating a time-series visualization showing bugs created per week and bugs closed per week. Delivers value by revealing quality trends and potential quality debt accumulation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have weekly bug data, **When** I view the Bug Trends chart, **Then** I see two lines: one showing new bugs per week and one showing closed bugs per week
2. **Given** the bug creation rate exceeds closure rate for 3+ consecutive weeks, **When** the chart renders, **Then** I see a visual indicator highlighting this concerning trend
3. **Given** I select a specific date range, **When** the chart updates, **Then** the trend lines adjust to show only data within my selected range
4. **Given** there is a week with zero bug activity, **When** the chart renders, **Then** that week shows zero values rather than being omitted from the timeline

### User Story 3 - Analyze Bug Investment (Priority: P2)

As a scrum master, I want to see how much effort (story points) my team is investing in bug fixes so that I can quantify the impact of quality issues on our velocity and plan accordingly.

**Why this priority**: Understanding bug investment helps teams quantify technical debt and make data-driven decisions about when to focus on quality improvements vs new features. This is secondary to knowing about bugs themselves but critical for capacity planning.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by displaying total story points invested in bugs per week when story points data is available. Delivers value by quantifying the cost of quality issues in team capacity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** bugs have story points assigned, **When** I view the Bug Investment chart, **Then** I see both bug items per week and story points invested in bugs per week displayed together
2. **Given** some bugs have no story points, **When** calculating bug investment, **Then** those bugs are excluded from the points calculation but always counted in the item count
3. **Given** bug points exceed 30% of total weekly capacity for 2+ weeks, **When** the dashboard calculates metrics, **Then** I see a warning indicator suggesting to review quality practices
4. **Given** no bugs have story points assigned, **When** I view the Bug Investment section, **Then** I see bug item counts with a note "Story points data not available"

---

### User Story 4 - Receive Actionable Quality Insights (Priority: P2)

As a development manager, I want to receive actionable recommendations based on bug patterns so that I can make informed decisions about quality improvement initiatives without needing to interpret raw data myself.

**Why this priority**: Raw metrics are useful but actionable insights are what drive behavior change. This helps teams move from awareness to action.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering various bug patterns (high creation rate, low closure rate, increasing bug debt) and verifying appropriate recommendations appear. Delivers value by translating data into specific actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the bug closure rate is below 70%, **When** insights are calculated, **Then** I see a recommendation: "Consider dedicating more capacity to bug resolution"
2. **Given** new bugs per week are increasing over a 4-week period, **When** insights are calculated, **Then** I see a warning: "Bug creation rate is trending upward - review testing practices"
3. **Given** the open bug count has decreased by 20% in the last month, **When** insights are calculated, **Then** I see a positive message: "Great progress! Bug count trending downward"
4. **Given** multiple quality concerns exist simultaneously, **When** insights display, **Then** recommendations are prioritized by severity with the most critical shown first

---

### User Story 5 - Forecast Bug Resolution Timeline (Priority: P3)

As a release manager, I want to see forecasts for when open bugs will be resolved based on historical closure rates so that I can set realistic expectations for bug-free release dates.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for planning, forecasting is less critical than understanding current state and trends. Teams need to first know they have a problem before forecasting when it will be resolved.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a forecast line showing projected bug closure dates based on recent velocity. Delivers value by helping plan release timing and resource needs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have at least 4 weeks of bug closure data, **When** forecasting is enabled, **Then** I see an optimistic and pessimistic forecast for when open bugs will be resolved
2. **Given** the bug closure rate is zero or negative (more created than closed), **When** forecasting runs, **Then** I see a message "Unable to forecast - bug count increasing" instead of projection lines
3. **Given** I adjust the timeline filter, **When** forecasts recalculate, **Then** projections use only the selected time period's closure rate
4. **Given** there are fewer than 4 weeks of data, **When** forecasting attempts to run, **Then** I see a message "Insufficient data for forecasting (minimum 4 weeks required)"

### Edge Cases

- **Custom issue type names**: System uses configurable mappings in app_settings.json (e.g., "Defect" → "bug")
- **Bugs created before timeline**: System includes in resolution statistics if closed within timeline (see FR-020)
- **Bug type changes mid-lifecycle**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE - System uses issue type at query time; historical type changes are not tracked
- **Outliers in story points**: System displays all values without filtering; UI may add visual indicators for outliers
- **Project switching**: System reloads bug type mappings from app_settings.json for each project
- **Multiple bug-like types**: System maps all configured types (Bug, Defect, Incident) to "bug" category via app_settings.json

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
