## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS**: Specification contains no implementation details. All descriptions focus on WHAT users need (bug metrics, visualizations, insights) without specifying HOW (no mention of Python, Dash, Plotly, specific libraries, or code structure).

✅ **PASS**: Content is focused on user value - each user story explains the business need and value proposition. Examples: "assess quality status", "identify quality concerns", "make data-driven decisions about quality improvements".

✅ **PASS**: Language is appropriate for non-technical stakeholders. Uses business terms (project manager, team lead, quality status, resolution rate) rather than technical jargon.

✅ **PASS**: All mandatory sections are complete:
- User Scenarios & Testing (5 prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria)
- Requirements (20 functional requirements + 5 key entities)
- Success Criteria (10 measurable outcomes)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are fully specified with reasonable defaults documented in assumptions.

✅ **PASS**: Requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each FR has clear, verifiable conditions:
- FR-003: "calculate total bug count, open bug count, and closed bug count"
- FR-007: "calculate bug resolution rate as (closed bugs / total bugs) × 100"
- FR-013: "display a warning when bug creation rate exceeds closure rate for 3+ consecutive weeks"

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- SC-001: "within 2 seconds"
- SC-003: "within 500ms"
- SC-006: "80% of users find actionable"
- SC-008: "within ±1 week accuracy"

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria are technology-agnostic. No mention of specific technologies:
- Uses "Users can view" not "Dashboard renders with React"
- Uses "System correctly identifies" not "Python function filters issues"
- Uses "render within 500ms" not "Plotly chart performance"

✅ **PASS**: All acceptance scenarios defined. Each user story (P1-P5) has 4 detailed Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy path, edge cases, and filtering behavior.

✅ **PASS**: Edge cases identified with 6 specific scenarios:
- Custom issue type names (Defect vs Bug)
- Timeline boundary conditions
- Type changes mid-lifecycle
- Outlier handling
- Multi-project consistency
- Multiple bug-like types

✅ **PASS**: Scope is clearly bounded:
- IN SCOPE: Bug analysis, metrics, trends, forecasting, insights
- OUT OF SCOPE: Bug fixing workflows, bug assignment, bug priority management (implied by absence)
- Clear dependencies: Existing JIRA integration, timeline filters, story points field

✅ **PASS**: Dependencies and assumptions identified through requirements:
- Depends on FR-015: "issuetype" field from JIRA API
- Assumes FR-006: existing timeline filter infrastructure
- Assumes FR-016: existing caching mechanism

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS**: All functional requirements linked to acceptance criteria through user stories:
- FR-001-FR-004 → User Story 1 acceptance scenarios
- FR-008, FR-013 → User Story 2 acceptance scenarios
- FR-009-FR-010 → User Story 3 acceptance scenarios

✅ **PASS**: User scenarios cover primary flows comprehensively:
1. Overview and metrics display (P1)
2. Trend analysis and pattern detection (P1)
3. Investment quantification (P2)
4. Actionable insights (P2)
5. Forecasting (P3)

✅ **PASS**: Feature meets measurable outcomes - Success Criteria align with User Stories:
- SC-001, SC-004, SC-010 → Support User Story 1
- SC-002, SC-003, SC-005 → Support User Story 2
- SC-007 → Supports User Story 3
- SC-006 → Supports User Story 4
- SC-008 → Supports User Story 5

✅ **PASS**: No implementation details leak. Verified all sections maintain abstraction level appropriate for specification.

## Assumptions Documented

The following assumptions are made based on industry standards, existing project context, and user clarifications:

1. **Issue Type Field**: JIRA provides a standard "issuetype" field that can distinguish between Bug, Story, Task, etc. Adding this field to the fetch list is the first development task (not a blocker for planning)
2. **Bug Type Configuration Approach** (User Decision - Q1):
   - Implement full configuration system allowing users to map any JIRA issue type to the "Bug" concept in the app
   - Support field mapping: users can map "Defect" → "Bug", "Incident" → "Bug", or custom type names
   - Default to "Bug" issue type (zero configuration required for main use case)
   - Advanced users can configure custom mappings when their JIRA uses different terminology
3. **Testing Data Strategy** (User Decision - Q2):
   - Primary: Use public jira.atlassian.com instance for integration testing
   - Fallback: Use mock data if public JIRA unavailable or lacks bug-related issue types
   - This ensures testing can always proceed regardless of external dependencies
4. **Quality Insights Implementation** (User Decision - Q3):
   - Simple threshold-based rules matching specification examples (70% resolution rate, 30% capacity threshold)
   - Mathematical forecasting formulas consistent with existing PERT-based approach
   - Statistical analysis (trends, averages, percentages) - YES
   - Machine learning - NO (not in scope for initial implementation)
5. **Timeline Filtering**: Existing timeline filter infrastructure (from burndown charts) can be reused for bug analysis
6. **Weekly Granularity**: Bug metrics use weekly aggregation matching existing statistics structure
7. **Minimum Forecasting Data**: 4 weeks of historical data is sufficient for basic forecasting (industry standard for velocity-based forecasting)
8. **Dual Metrics Display**: Item counts are always shown (primary metric), with story points displayed as supplementary data when available - consistent with existing charts in the application
9. **Resolution Rate Threshold**: 70% resolution rate is considered healthy (common industry benchmark)
10. **Capacity Warning Threshold**: Bug investment exceeding 30% of capacity for 2+ weeks indicates quality issues (based on agile best practices)
11. **Performance Targets**: 2-second load time and 500ms render time align with existing application performance standards

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - all quality checks passed
- No clarifications needed from user - all requirements are complete with reasonable defaults
- Edge cases are well-defined and will guide implementation planning
- Success criteria provide clear definition of done for testing and validation
