# Specification Quality Checklist: Metrics Performance & Logging Optimization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: November 9, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items passed successfully.

**Spec Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ User stories are properly prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with clear dependencies
- ✅ All 27 functional requirements are testable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ 10 success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- ✅ Edge cases cover important failure scenarios
- ✅ Assumptions document current system state and constraints
- ✅ Dependencies clearly reference existing modules
- ✅ Out of scope section prevents scope creep

**Readiness**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
