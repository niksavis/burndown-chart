# Specification Quality Checklist: DORA and Flow Metrics Dashboard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 27, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks complete

**Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: All sections focus on "what" and "why" without implementation details. Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 32 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements have clear, specific definitions based on the DORA_Flow_Jira_Mapping.md reference document.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - Performance targets (5 seconds load time, 10 seconds recalculation)
   - Accuracy targets (100% tier categorization, 1% calculation margin)
   - User experience targets (95% successful configuration without help)
   - System capacity targets (5,000 issues in 15 seconds)

4. **Feature Readiness**: Six prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover all primary flows from basic metric viewing to advanced export. Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance criteria.

**Notes**:

- The specification makes reasonable assumptions documented in the Assumptions section (e.g., users have Jira API access, organizations track deployments in Jira)
- Dependencies are clearly identified (Jira REST API, existing Jira integration, Plotly library)
- Out-of-scope items are explicitly listed to prevent scope creep
- Edge cases cover all major failure scenarios (missing data, API limits, permission issues, large datasets)

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.
