# Feature Specification: Unified UX/UI and Architecture Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `006-ux-ui-redesign`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we need to redesign the app so it is uniform from ux/ui perspective and uniform from the software design perspective without breaking anything. one of the major issues is that the input parameters are below the graphs and when user wants to change something on the fly they have to scroll down to do it. But on the other side, if we put the input parameters on the side, then the graphs will not be visible, and the mobile view will probably look terrible. Second thing, I think that the Project Dashboard could have been its own tab, the 1st tab that is shown when the app starts, instead of showing it below the charts. As an expert software and ux/ui designer find other points of improvements that will make the app a better customer experience."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Parameter Adjustments While Viewing Charts (Priority: P1)

As a project manager reviewing burndown charts, I need to quickly adjust forecast parameters (PERT factors, deadlines, scope) while simultaneously viewing their impact on the visualizations, so I can perform real-time what-if analysis without losing context or excessive scrolling.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the primary pain point identified - users currently must scroll away from charts to adjust parameters, breaking their analytical flow. This is the most frequently used interaction pattern and directly impacts core workflow efficiency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by placing parameter controls in a persistent, accessible location (sticky panel, collapsible sidebar, or floating controls) and verifying users can modify any parameter while chart remains visible. Success measured by zero scrolling required to adjust parameters while viewing charts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the burndown forecast chart, **When** I want to change the deadline date, **Then** I can access the deadline input field without scrolling or navigating away from the chart
2. **Given** I am on a mobile device viewing any chart, **When** I need to adjust PERT factors, **Then** the parameter controls are accessible via a slide-in panel or bottom sheet that doesn't obscure the chart completely
3. **Given** I have adjusted a parameter (e.g., total items), **When** the calculation completes, **Then** the chart updates immediately and I can see the new forecast without changing my view
4. **Given** I am analyzing multiple scenarios, **When** I toggle between showing/hiding parameter controls, **Then** the transition is smooth (<200ms) and the chart repositions without losing zoom or pan state
5. **Given** I am on a tablet device in portrait orientation, **When** parameter controls are visible, **Then** both controls and chart remain usable with minimum 40% screen space for chart visualization

---

### User Story 2 - Dashboard as Primary Landing View (Priority: P1)

As a project stakeholder checking project health, I need to see the Project Dashboard (summary metrics, PERT forecasts, completion timeline) immediately when opening the app, so I can quickly understand project status before diving into detailed charts.

**Why this priority**: Dashboard provides at-a-glance project health - the most common information need. Making it the default view improves information scent and reduces time to insight for the majority of users (stakeholders, managers checking status).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making Dashboard the first tab in navigation, verifying it loads as default on app startup, and measuring time-to-first-meaningful-content. Success measured by users seeing key metrics (completion forecast, remaining work, velocity) within 2 seconds of app load.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the application for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** the Dashboard tab is active and displays project summary, forecast timeline, and velocity metrics
2. **Given** I refresh the browser or return to the app, **When** the page reloads, **Then** the Dashboard tab is selected by default (unless user previously selected a different tab and we preserve that state)
3. **Given** I am viewing the Dashboard on mobile, **When** the page loads, **Then** critical metrics (days to completion, remaining work, velocity) are visible above the fold without scrolling
4. **Given** I need detailed breakdown, **When** I interact with dashboard summary cards, **Then** I can navigate to corresponding detailed chart tabs (e.g., click on "Velocity" metric to see items/week chart)
5. **Given** Dashboard is the active tab, **When** I access parameter controls, **Then** changes immediately update dashboard metrics without requiring navigation to another tab

---

### User Story 3 - Consistent Visual Language and Component Patterns (Priority: P2)

As a user navigating between different sections of the app, I need consistent visual styling, navigation patterns, and interaction behaviors across all views, so I can build mental models and use the app more efficiently without relearning patterns.

**Why this priority**: Design consistency reduces cognitive load and improves learnability. While less urgent than workflow improvements, it significantly impacts user confidence and satisfaction. Essential for professional appearance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by auditing all UI components (buttons, cards, forms, navigation) against a design system checklist, verifying consistent spacing, typography, colors, and interaction patterns. Success measured by 100% component compliance with design tokens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I navigate between different tabs, **When** each view loads, **Then** all action buttons follow the same visual style (colors, sizes, icon placement) and semantic meaning (primary actions use primary color, destructive actions use danger color)
2. **Given** I interact with input fields across different sections, **When** I focus, type, or submit data, **Then** all fields share consistent styling (border colors, focus states, validation feedback) and behavior
3. **Given** I view cards containing information (dashboard cards, forecast info, statistics), **When** comparing across views, **Then** all cards use consistent padding, shadows, border radius, and header styling
4. **Given** I use navigation elements (tabs, mobile bottom nav, drawer), **When** switching between views, **Then** active state indicators are consistent and transition animations follow the same timing and easing
5. **Given** I am on mobile vs desktop, **When** viewing the same content, **Then** layouts adapt responsively but maintain consistent component styling and information hierarchy

---

### User Story 4 - Unified Software Architecture with Clear Separation (Priority: P2)

As a developer maintaining the application, I need clear separation of concerns (presentation, business logic, data persistence) with consistent patterns for event handling, state management, and component composition, so I can modify features without introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.

**Why this priority**: Architecture consistency reduces maintenance burden and prevents technical debt accumulation. Critical for long-term maintainability but doesn't directly impact user experience. Should be addressed before codebase grows further.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by code review against architecture guidelines: presentation logic separated from business calculations, no data persistence operations in UI code, state managed centrally. Success measured by architectural compliance and reduced cross-layer dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I need to add a new chart type, **When** I implement the feature, **Then** I can follow a clear pattern: create visualization component, implement data transformation logic, register in navigation system, without modifying core application structure
2. **Given** I need to modify parameter calculation logic, **When** I change data processing code, **Then** changes are isolated to business logic layer and UI automatically reflects updated values through existing data binding
3. **Given** I need to add a new user input field, **When** I implement it, **Then** I use standardized component creation patterns (like existing form builders) and consistent event handling for state updates
4. **Given** multiple features depend on the same data, **When** data updates, **Then** state is managed centrally to prevent inconsistencies, race conditions, and redundant calculations
5. **Given** I need to understand how a feature works, **When** I trace through the code, **Then** I can follow a clear path: presentation component → event handler → business logic → data layer, with each layer having a single, clear responsibility

---

### User Story 5 - Responsive Layout with Optimized Mobile Experience (Priority: P3)

As a mobile user checking project status on my phone, I need optimized layouts that prioritize essential information, use touch-friendly controls, and adapt navigation patterns to mobile constraints, so I can efficiently access project data on any device.

**Why this priority**: Mobile usability is important but represents a smaller user segment compared to desktop analytics workflows. Current mobile navigation exists but could be improved. Can be refined after addressing primary workflow issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested on devices with screen sizes from 320px to 768px, verifying touch targets meet 44px minimum, critical information is above the fold, and navigation is accessible without obscuring content. Success measured by mobile task completion rates matching desktop.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on a mobile device (< 768px), **When** I access parameter controls, **Then** they appear in a bottom sheet or slide-in panel that uses maximum 60% of screen height, allowing chart to remain partially visible
2. **Given** I am viewing charts on mobile, **When** I interact with chart elements, **Then** touch targets are minimum 44px, pinch-to-zoom works smoothly, and tooltip/hover information adapts to touch interactions
3. **Given** I am using mobile navigation, **When** I switch between tabs, **Then** navigation uses bottom tab bar or swipe gestures with clear visual feedback, and content transitions are smooth (<300ms)
4. **Given** I am filling out input fields on mobile, **When** the keyboard appears, **Then** the viewport adjusts so the active field remains visible and submit button is accessible without closing keyboard
5. **Given** I am on a tablet in landscape mode (768px-1024px), **When** viewing the app, **Then** layout uses a hybrid approach with sidebar navigation visible and chart taking primary screen space

---

### User Story 6 - Contextual Help System with Progressive Disclosure (Priority: P3)

As a new user learning the application, I need contextual help that explains features when needed without cluttering the interface, so I can discover functionality progressively as I explore different sections.

**Why this priority**: Improves onboarding and discoverability but existing app already has tooltips and help system. Enhancement rather than critical fix. Can be refined after core UX improvements are complete.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by tracking help tooltip usage, measuring time to first successful task completion for new users, and verifying help content is accessible within one click from relevant features. Success measured by reduced support requests.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I hover over or tap an unfamiliar term (e.g., "PERT Factor"), **When** the tooltip appears, **Then** it provides a concise explanation (<50 words) with optional "Learn more" link to detailed help
2. **Given** I am viewing a complex feature (e.g., PERT forecast), **When** I click the info icon, **Then** a help modal explains the feature purpose, calculation method, and how to interpret results
3. **Given** I am a first-time user, **When** I load the Dashboard, **Then** I see subtle "?" icons next to key metrics that reveal contextual help without obstructing the data
4. **Given** I am using mobile with limited screen space, **When** I access help content, **Then** it appears in a full-screen overlay or bottom sheet that I can easily dismiss
5. **Given** I have read help content once, **When** I return to the same section, **Then** help indicators remain available but don't show automatic tips/tours unless I re-enable them

---

### User Story 7 - Settings Panel with JIRA Integration & Data Management (Priority: P1) 🆕 NEW SCOPE

As a project manager configuring the burndown chart application, I need a unified settings panel that consolidates JIRA configuration, data source management, and import/export capabilities in an easily accessible collapsible panel, so I can configure and manage all data sources and settings without navigating away from my current view.

**Why this priority**: During implementation of User Stories 1 and 2, it became clear that JIRA configuration (from Feature 003) and data management should be as easily accessible as forecast parameters. This follows the same collapsible panel UX pattern, creating a consistent and intuitive configuration experience. Essential for users adopting JIRA integration or managing data sources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by expanding settings panel and verifying: (1) JIRA config button opens configuration modal, (2) JQL query editor has syntax highlighting and validation, (3) Saved queries can be created/loaded/edited/deleted, (4) "Update Data" button fetches from JIRA with status feedback, (5) Import accepts JSON/CSV files, (6) Export downloads current project data. Success measured by complete configuration workflow without leaving main view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing any chart or dashboard, **When** I need to configure JIRA integration, **Then** I can expand the settings panel below the parameter panel and access the JIRA configuration button without scrolling or navigation
2. **Given** I have JIRA credentials configured, **When** I enter a JQL query in the editor, **Then** the editor provides syntax highlighting, autocomplete suggestions, and character count feedback (with warning at >900 characters)
3. **Given** I have created multiple JQL queries, **When** I access the saved queries dropdown, **Then** I can save current query with a name, load saved queries, edit existing queries, delete queries, and set a default query marked with ★
4. **Given** I have configured JIRA and entered a JQL query, **When** I click "Update Data" button, **Then** system fetches issues from JIRA, displays loading status, updates cache, recalculates scope metrics, and refreshes dashboard/charts automatically
5. **Given** I have project data loaded, **When** I click "Export Data" button, **Then** system downloads a JSON file containing project_data.json with all statistics, scope, and metadata
6. **Given** I have exported project data or received a data file, **When** I drag and drop JSON/CSV file into import area or click to browse, **Then** system validates file format, imports data, updates statistics store, and refreshes all visualizations
7. **Given** settings panel is open, **When** I expand parameter panel, **Then** settings panel automatically collapses to avoid cluttering the interface (only one panel open at a time)
8. **Given** I am on mobile device (<768px), **When** I access settings panel, **Then** layout adapts to single-column with JIRA integration and import/export stacked vertically, touch targets meet 44px minimum
9. **Given** JIRA configuration is incomplete or invalid, **When** settings panel loads, **Then** status indicator shows configuration state (unconfigured/configured/error) with visual feedback
10. **Given** I save a JQL query profile, **When** I reload the application, **Then** my saved queries persist and last selected query is remembered

**Implementation Notes**:
- Integrates JIRA config modal from Feature 003 (003-jira-config-separation)
- Integrates JQL editor from Feature 004 (004-bug-analysis-dashboard) with syntax highlighting
- Follows same collapsible panel pattern as Parameter Panel for UX consistency
- Positioned between Parameter Panel and chart tabs in layout
- Two-column layout on desktop: JIRA integration (left 8 cols), Import/Export (right 4 cols)
- Single-column stacked layout on mobile for touch optimization

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when parameter controls are open on mobile and user rotates device?** System should detect orientation change and reposition controls appropriately (bottom sheet for portrait, sidebar for landscape) without losing user's input state.

- **How does system handle slow data updates when user rapidly changes multiple parameters?** Implement debouncing (500ms) and show loading indicator; if new parameter change occurs before calculation completes, cancel previous calculation and start new one.

- **What happens if Dashboard data fails to load but charts load successfully?** Show error state in Dashboard tab with specific error message and retry button, but allow navigation to other tabs so users can still access chart functionality.

- **How does layout adapt on very small screens (< 360px width)?** Components stack vertically with reduced padding, font sizes scale down (min 14px for body text), and bottom navigation switches to horizontal scrolling or 3-item layout with overflow menu.

- **What happens when user has very long project names or metric labels in Dashboard cards?** Text truncates with ellipsis and shows full content on hover/tap, or uses multi-line layout with max 2 lines before truncating.

- **How does sticky/floating parameter panel behave during chart interactions (zoom, pan)?** Panel remains in fixed position with sufficient z-index to stay above chart, but includes collapse/minimize button so users can temporarily hide it for full chart view.

- **What happens when mobile keyboard appears while parameter sheet is open?** Parameter sheet automatically resizes to fit available viewport minus keyboard height, ensuring active input field and submit button remain visible.

- **How does navigation state persist across page refreshes?** Use `dcc.Store` with `local` storage type to remember last active tab, parameter panel state (open/closed), and user's preferred layout mode, restoring on reload.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Navigation and Information Architecture

- **FR-013**: Parameter control section MUST be visually distinct from chart area using subtle background color, border, or shadow while maintaining overall design consistency
- **FR-014**: System MUST debounce parameter inputs by 500ms to prevent excessive recalculations during rapid user adjustments (each parameter input independently debounced - user stops typing → wait 500ms → trigger calculation)
- **FR-015**: System MUST show loading indicators on affected charts when parameter calculations are in progress

#### Dashboard Tab Content

- **FR-016**: Dashboard tab MUST display project summary metrics including: remaining work (items/points), completion forecast date, average velocity, and days to deadline
- **FR-017**: Dashboard MUST show PERT forecast information (optimistic, pessimistic, most likely scenarios) with visual timeline representation
- **FR-018**: Dashboard cards MUST link to corresponding detailed chart tabs (e.g., clicking velocity metric navigates to Items per Week tab)

## Assumptions *(optional - document reasonable defaults)*

- **Design System**: We will use Bootstrap 5's design tokens as the foundation, customizing only primary/secondary colors to match current branding (#0d6efd primary blue)
- **Parameter Panel Default State**: On desktop, parameter controls will default to collapsed/minimized state on first visit, with state persisting across session after user manually expands
- **Mobile Bottom Sheet**: On mobile, parameter controls accessed via floating action button (FAB) will open bottom sheet that can be swiped down to dismiss
- **Tab Persistence**: Last active tab will persist in current session only (sessionStorage), not across browser sessions, unless user enables "Remember my preferences" option
- **Dashboard Default**: Dashboard will always be default tab for new users; returning users see Dashboard unless they changed tabs in current session
- **Settings Panel Default State (NEW)**: Settings panel defaults to collapsed on first visit, with state persisting across session after user manually expands
- **JIRA Configuration (NEW)**: Settings panel integrates JIRA config modal from Feature 003-jira-config-separation; existing JIRA settings are preserved and enhanced with UI access
- **JQL Query Profiles (NEW)**: Saved queries stored in jira_query_profiles.json with standard schema from Feature 004; profile management integrated into settings panel
- **Import/Export Format (NEW)**: Import supports JSON (project_data.json format) and CSV (statistics data); export generates standard project_data.json
- **Panel Coordination (NEW)**: Only one top panel (parameter or settings) can be open at a time to minimize screen space consumption
- **Chart Interactivity**: Current Plotly chart configurations for zoom, pan, and hover will be preserved; only layout container changes
- **Help System**: Existing help system infrastructure can be enhanced with additional tooltips without complete rebuild
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing data persistence (project_data.json, app_settings.json, statistics data) formats remain unchanged
- **Browser Support**: Target modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) released in last 2 years; IE11 not supported
- **Performance Baseline**: Current callback response times will serve as baseline; redesign should not degrade performance by more than 10%
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Use Bootstrap 5 standard breakpoints: mobile <768px, tablet 768px-992px, desktop ≥992px, wide desktop ≥1200px

## Dependencies *(optional - only if external factors)*

- No external dependencies - this is an internal UX/UI and architecture refactoring
- Feature builds on existing Dash, dash-bootstrap-components, and Plotly frameworks already in use
- No new external APIs or services required
- Changes should not impact existing JIRA integration functionality (Feature 003)

## Open Questions *(optional - only if truly blocking)*

None - all critical decisions can be made with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section. Specific implementation details (exact parameter panel style, specific responsive breakpoints) can be finalized during technical planning phase.

## Out of Scope *(optional - explicitly exclude to prevent scope creep)*

- **Complete Design System Overhaul**: We will standardize existing components but not redesign all visual assets, icons, or color schemes
- **New Feature Development**: This focuses on reorganizing and standardizing existing features; no new forecast algorithms or chart types (JIRA integration UI from Feature 003 is IN SCOPE as Settings Panel)
- **Data Migration**: Existing data formats remain unchanged; no migration scripts needed
- **Accessibility Audit**: While we'll maintain existing accessibility features, comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit is separate effort
- **Performance Optimization**: We'll maintain current performance levels but won't refactor calculation engines or implement caching beyond what exists
- **Advanced Mobile Features**: Native app features (offline mode, push notifications, home screen widgets) are out of scope
- **User Authentication**: Any user-specific preferences beyond session storage (user accounts, saved dashboards) are separate features
- **Internationalization**: UI text remains in English; translation support is separate effort
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching functionality is separate feature
- **Advanced Export/Print Features**: Enhanced export options beyond basic JSON/CSV download (PDF reports, custom formats, scheduled exports) are separate features

**Note on Scope Changes**: Settings Panel (User Story 7) was added during implementation to consolidate JIRA configuration and data management. This enhances the original vision by making all configuration easily accessible, following the same UX pattern as the Parameter Panel.

## Notes *(optional - additional context)*

### Current Architecture Analysis

The existing codebase already demonstrates some good practices:
- Clear module separation (`ui/`, `data/`, `callbacks/`, `visualization/`)
- Mobile navigation infrastructure exists (`mobile_navigation.py`)
- Help system foundation in place (`help_system.py`)
- Responsive grid utilities (`grid_utils.py`)

### Key Pain Points Identified

1. **Parameter Accessibility**: Input controls in `create_input_parameters_card()` rendered below charts in two-column layout, requiring scroll
2. **Dashboard Placement**: `create_project_summary_card()` rendered below charts instead of primary tab
3. **Inconsistent Navigation**: Desktop tabs vs mobile bottom nav use different active state patterns
4. **Component Styling Variance**: Cards, buttons, and inputs defined inline rather than using shared style utilities

### Recommended Refactoring Approach

1. **Phase 1 - Navigation Restructure** (P1 user stories):
   - Create new Dashboard tab component
   - Reorder tabs to make Dashboard first
   - Move parameter controls to persistent panel

2. **Phase 2 - Design System** (P2 user stories):
   - Extract component styles to `ui/style_constants.py`
   - Create standardized component creators
   - Audit and update all components for consistency

3. **Phase 3 - Polish** (P3 user stories):
   - Enhance responsive behaviors
   - Improve help system discoverability
   - Fine-tune mobile interactions

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

All changes must maintain compatibility with:
- Existing callback signatures (can add new callbacks, but not break existing)
- Data persistence formats (JSON files remain unchanged)
- URL routing and tab IDs (bookmarks should continue working)
- Component IDs used in tests (update tests if needed, but document breaking changes)
