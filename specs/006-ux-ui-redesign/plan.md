# Implementation Plan: Unified UX/UI and Architecture Redesign

**Branch**: `006-ux-ui-redesign` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-ux-ui-redesign/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Redesign the Burndown Chart Generator application to achieve UX/UI uniformity and architectural consistency. The primary requirements are:

1. **Parameter Accessibility**: Make input controls (PERT factors, deadline, scope) accessible without scrolling while viewing charts by implementing a collapsible sticky panel below the header
2. **Dashboard as Primary View**: Convert Project Dashboard into the first tab and make it the default landing view, showing key project metrics immediately on app startup
3. **Visual Consistency**: Standardize all UI components (buttons, cards, inputs, navigation) using consistent design tokens, spacing, and interaction patterns
4. **Architectural Uniformity**: Establish clear separation of concerns with consistent patterns for component creation, event handling, and state management
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance responsive layouts with touch-friendly controls and optimized navigation for mobile devices

**Technical Approach**: Refactor existing Dash application structure to introduce design system with standardized component builders, reorganize tab navigation to prioritize Dashboard, implement collapsible parameter control panel using Bootstrap utilities, and establish clear architectural patterns for future feature extensions.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11.12  
**Primary Dependencies**: 
  - Dash 3.1.1 (web framework)
  - dash-bootstrap-components 2.0.2 (UI components)
  - Plotly (chart visualization)
  - Flask (underlying web server)
  - Waitress (production WSGI server)
  - pytest 8.3.4 (testing framework)
  - Playwright (browser automation for integration tests - selected over Selenium, see research.md)
  
**Storage**: JSON files for persistence (project_data.json, app_settings.json, jira_cache.json, jira_query_profiles.json)  
**Testing**: pytest with markers (unit, integration, performance); coverage reporting via pytest-cov  
**Target Platform**: Web application (cross-browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge); mobile-responsive design (320px+)  
**Project Type**: Web application with mobile-first responsive design  
**Performance Goals**: 
  - Initial page load: < 2 seconds
  - Chart rendering: < 500ms
  - User interaction response: < 100ms
  - Parameter control transitions: < 300ms
  
**Constraints**: 
  - Must maintain backward compatibility with existing data formats (JSON files)
  - Must preserve all existing callback signatures or document breaking changes
  - Must not degrade current performance by more than 10%
  - Must support touch targets minimum 44px on mobile
  - Component builder pattern: Three-tier system (atoms/molecules/organisms) documented in contracts/component-builders.md
  
**Scale/Scope**: 
  - Single-page application with 6 main tabs (Dashboard, Burndown, Items/Week, Points/Week, Scope, Bug Analysis)
  - Approximately 15 reusable UI components requiring standardization
  - 8 callback modules requiring architectural alignment
  - Mobile-first design targeting 320px-1920px viewport range

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Status**: The `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file exists but contains only template placeholders. The project uses `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as the primary development guidelines document.

### Initial Check (Before Phase 0)

**Project Guidelines Analysis** (from copilot-instructions.md):

✅ **Mobile-First Design**: Feature aligns with "Mobile-First Design Strategy" principle - redesigning parameter controls and dashboard for mobile accessibility

✅ **Modern Web App Principles**: Supports "User Experience Excellence" goals - reducing cognitive load, progressive disclosure, immediate value delivery

✅ **Performance-First Architecture**: Maintains performance targets (< 2s page load, < 500ms chart rendering) defined in guidelines

✅ **Component Architecture**: Follows "Atomic Design System" and "Modern Component Architecture" patterns for UI consistency

✅ **State Management**: Aligns with "State Management Optimization" using dcc.Store and centralized state

✅ **Testing Strategy**: Follows "Modern Testing Strategy" with unit, integration, and performance tests

✅ **Accessibility**: Supports "Basic WCAG Compliance" with 44px touch targets and keyboard navigation

✅ **PowerShell Development**: No shell command conflicts - feature is UI/architecture refactoring

**Initial Gate Result**: ✅ **PASSED**

### Re-Evaluation After Phase 1 Design

**Phase 1 Deliverables Review**:

✅ **research.md**: All technical decisions documented with rationale, alternatives considered, and implementation guidance. Decisions align with project patterns (Playwright testing, Bootstrap breakpoints, centralized design tokens).

✅ **data-model.md**: Comprehensive entity definitions for UI state, component configuration, and dashboard metrics. No changes to existing business data entities (backward compatibility maintained).

✅ **contracts/component-builders.md**: Standardized API contracts for three-tier component system (atoms/molecules/organisms). Follows existing project patterns with clear validation, accessibility, and testing requirements.

✅ **contracts/callbacks.md**: Detailed callback contracts with performance targets, error handling patterns, and dependency graphs. Aligns with existing callback architecture.

✅ **quickstart.md**: Developer guide with PowerShell-specific commands, step-by-step task implementation, troubleshooting, and best practices matching project conventions.

**Architecture Compliance**:

✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Design maintains clear boundaries between presentation (ui/), business logic (data/), and event handling (callbacks/)

✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing data formats preserved, existing callbacks maintain signatures, backward compatibility guaranteed

✅ **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test strategy with unit tests, integration tests (Playwright), and performance benchmarks

✅ **Mobile-First**: Responsive breakpoint strategy, touch target requirements, mobile navigation patterns all documented

✅ **Performance Targets**: All callbacks have defined execution time limits, caching strategies, and optimization patterns

✅ **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility built into component contracts

**Final Gate Result**: ✅ **PASSED**

**Post-Design Verification**:
- No architectural violations introduced
- All designs follow existing project patterns
- Performance requirements clearly defined and achievable
- Testing strategy comprehensive and aligned with project guidelines
- No technical debt introduced by design decisions

**Ready to Proceed**: Yes - design phase complete, ready for implementation (Phase 2: Task Breakdown)

**Structure Decision**: This is a web application using the existing Dash structure. The feature will modify presentation layer (`ui/`), enhance callbacks for new Dashboard tab, and maintain separation between business logic (`data/`) and visualization (`visualization/`). No new top-level directories needed - all changes fit within existing architecture.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

**Status**: No violations detected. This feature refactors existing architecture to improve consistency and maintainability without introducing additional complexity or violating project principles.
