# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified UX/UI and Architecture Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for Planning

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ All technical details moved to Notes section or rewritten as technology-agnostic requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ Six prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) with clear business value explanations
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ Architecture requirements rewritten without specific file paths or framework names
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present and comprehensive

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✅ FR-007 resolved with Option C (sticky top section with beautiful, functional design)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ All 41 FRs include specific, measurable criteria (e.g., "maximum 50px height", "within 300ms")
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ All 12 SCs include quantitative targets (0 scroll events, <500ms, 100% compliance)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✅ No mention of specific frameworks, libraries, or code modules in success criteria
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ Each user story has 5 detailed Given-When-Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ Eight comprehensive edge cases covering rotation, rapid input, errors, small screens
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes 10 potential scope creep areas
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ Dependencies: None (internal refactoring). Assumptions: 11 documented defaults

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ FRs linked to user story acceptance scenarios; measurable criteria in each FR
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ P1: Parameter adjustment + Dashboard landing (core workflows)
  - ✅ P2: Design consistency + Architecture (quality & maintainability)
  - ✅ P3: Mobile optimization + Help system (enhancement)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ 12 success criteria with specific targets align with user stories and FRs
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Validation iteration 2: Architecture FRs rewritten as technology-agnostic patterns

## Validation History

**Iteration 1** (2025-10-23 - Initial):
- ❌ FR-007 contained [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker
- ❌ FR-031 to FR-037 mentioned specific file paths and framework components

**Iteration 2** (2025-10-23 - Final):
- ✅ FR-007 resolved with sticky top section pattern (Option C + beautiful/functional requirement)
- ✅ Architecture FRs rewritten: "presentation layer" instead of "ui/ module", "state containers" instead of "dcc.Store"
- ✅ User Story 4 updated to use technology-agnostic language

## Notes

- Specification ready for `/speckit.plan` - no blocking issues remain
- Parameter control pattern (sticky collapsible top section) balances desktop and mobile needs
- Architecture requirements focus on separation of concerns without prescribing specific implementations
- Technical implementation guidance preserved in Notes section for development team
