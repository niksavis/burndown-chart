# Tasks: Unified UX/UI and Architecture Redesign

**UPDATED**: 2025-10-25 - Scope expanded to include Settings Panel implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-ux-ui-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/component-builders.md, contracts/callbacks.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage is included for validation and quality assurance (Phase 9: Integration & Testing). Tests are written after implementation to verify functionality, not using strict TDD red-green-refactor approach. All new code should have >80% test coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SCOPE CHANGE NOTICE

The implementation scope has expanded to include a **Settings Panel** (User Story 7 - NEW) that consolidates:
- JIRA Configuration (modal integration from Feature 003)
- JQL Query Editor with syntax highlighting
- Saved Queries management (save/edit/delete)
- Data fetch/update functionality
- Import/Export capabilities (CSV/JSON)

This panel follows the same collapsible UX pattern as the Parameter Panel and is positioned between the Parameter Panel and the main chart tabs.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, **US7** - NEW)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Web application structure:
- UI layer: `ui/` (presentation components)
- Callbacks: `callbacks/` (event handlers)
- Business logic: `data/` (calculations, persistence)
- Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`
- Assets: `assets/` (CSS, JavaScript)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-4B)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Parameter Panel) and US2 (Dashboard) ‚úÖ DONE - P1 priority completed first
  - **US7 (Settings Panel) ‚úÖ DONE - NEW SCOPE** - Was implemented alongside US1/US2
  - US3 and US4 (P2 priority) can proceed now that P1 stories complete
  - US5 and US6 (P3 priority) can proceed after Phase 2, but benefit from all P1/P2 stories
- **Integration & Testing (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on Phase 9 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: ‚úÖ DONE - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: ‚úÖ DONE - Uses component builders from Phase 2 but independent of US1
- **User Story 7 (P1 - NEW)**: ‚úÖ DONE - Independent implementation, follows same pattern as US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Benefits from US1/US2/US7 having components to refactor
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: üîú PENDING - Independent of other stories, focuses on architecture cleanup
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: üîú PENDING - Benefits from US1/US7 parameter/settings panels existing to create mobile variants
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: üîú PENDING - Independent, adds help to existing components from all stories

### Within Each User Story

**US1 (DONE)**: All tasks completed sequentially and in parallel as planned

**US2 (DONE)**: All tasks completed with calculations and UI built in parallel, then composed

**US7 (DONE - NEW)**: T119-T136 completed - panel structure, JIRA integration, JQL editor, import/export all implemented

**US3 (IN PROGRESS)**: T040-T043 can run in parallel (refactoring different component types)

**US4 (PENDING)**: T053-T056 can run in parallel (auditing different callback modules)

**US5 (PENDING)**: T068-T070, T137 can run in parallel (mobile components, settings panel mobile adaptation)

**US6 (PENDING)**: T084-T087, T139 can all run in parallel (help components and content including settings help)

## Notes

- **Settings Panel (US7)**: NEW SCOPE added during implementation. Combines JIRA integration from Feature 003 with unified data management UX. Follows same collapsible pattern as Parameter Panel for consistency.
- All tasks follow PowerShell development environment requirements (Windows with `.\.venv\Scripts\activate;` prefix)
- Component builders must follow contracts in `specs/006-ux-ui-redesign/contracts/component-builders.md`
- Callbacks must follow contracts in `specs/006-ux-ui-redesign/contracts/callbacks.md`
- Design tokens from `ui/style_constants.py` MUST be used instead of inline styles
- No changes to existing data formats in `data/persistence.py` (backward compatibility maintained)
- Playwright recommended for new integration tests over Selenium
- Mobile breakpoint: <768px, Tablet: 768px-992px, Desktop: ‚â•992px
- Touch targets on mobile must be minimum 44px √ó 44px
- Performance target: ‚â§10% regression from baseline
- Each user story should be independently testable before moving to next
- [P] tasks can run in parallel - different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
