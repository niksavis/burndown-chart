# Tasks: Unified UX/UI and Architecture Redesign

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-ux-ui-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/component-builders.md, contracts/callbacks.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage is included for validation and quality assurance (Phase 9: Integration & Testing). Tests are written after implementation to verify functionality, not using strict TDD red-green-refactor approach. All new code should have >80% test coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Web application structure:
- UI layer: `ui/` (presentation components)
- Callbacks: `callbacks/` (event handlers)
- Business logic: `data/` (calculations, persistence)
- Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`
- Assets: `assets/` (CSS, JavaScript)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and design system foundation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 (P1 priority) can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
  - US3 and US4 (P2 priority) can proceed in parallel after Phase 2, but benefit from US1/US2 completion
  - US5 and US6 (P3 priority) can proceed after Phase 2, but benefit from all P1/P2 stories
- **Integration & Testing (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on Phase 9 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses component builders from Phase 2 but independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Benefits from US1/US2 having components to refactor, but can start after Phase 2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Independent of other stories, can start after Phase 2 - focuses on architecture cleanup
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Benefits from US1 parameter panel existing to create mobile variant
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Independent, can start after Phase 2 - adds help to any existing components

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: T014 and T015 can run in parallel (collapsed bar and expanded section), then T016 combines them
- **US2**: T025-T028 can all run in parallel (calculations and UI components), then T029-T033 compose them
- **US3**: T040-T043 can all run in parallel (refactoring different component types)
- **US4**: T053-T056 can all run in parallel (auditing different callback modules)
- **US5**: T066-T069 can run in parallel (mobile components and breakpoints)
- **US6**: T081-T084 can all run in parallel (help components and content)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 Setup**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 Foundational**: T006, T007, T008, T010, T011 can all run in parallel after T005 design tokens are established

**Phase 3 (US1)**: T013 and T014 can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T025, T026, T027, T028 can all run in parallel - different file locations

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T040, T041, T042, T043 can all run in parallel - refactoring different files

**Phase 6 (US4)**: T053, T054, T055, T056 can all run in parallel - auditing different files

**Phase 7 (US5)**: T066, T067, T068 can all run in parallel at start of phase

**Phase 8 (US6)**: T081, T082, T083, T084 can all run in parallel

**Phase 9 Integration**: T094, T095, T096, T097, T098, T099 can all run in parallel - independent test files

**Phase 10 Polish**: T105, T106, T107, T108 can all run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Dashboard)

```bash
# Launch all calculation and UI component tasks together:
Task: "Create DashboardMetrics calculation function in data/processing.py"
Task: "Create PERTTimelineData calculation function in data/processing.py"
Task: "Create dashboard metrics card organism in ui/cards.py"
Task: "Create dashboard PERT timeline visualization function in visualization/charts.py"

# All above tasks work on different files with no dependencies
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (4 tasks)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks) - CRITICAL foundation
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (12 tasks) - Parameter panel accessibility
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (15 tasks) - Dashboard as landing view
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US2 independently
6. Deploy/demo MVP with core functionality

**MVP Value**: Users can see Dashboard on load (US2) and adjust parameters without scrolling (US1) - addresses primary pain points

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Design system ready
2. **Sprint 2**: User Story 1 ‚Üí Parameter panel working ‚Üí Test independently
3. **Sprint 3**: User Story 2 ‚Üí Dashboard as default ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy MVP**
4. **Sprint 4**: User Story 3 ‚Üí Visual consistency ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
5. **Sprint 5**: User Story 4 ‚Üí Architecture cleanup ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
6. **Sprint 6**: User Story 5 ‚Üí Mobile optimization ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
7. **Sprint 7**: User Story 6 + Integration + Polish ‚Üí Complete feature

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Parameter Panel) - 12 tasks
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Dashboard) - 15 tasks  
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Visual Consistency) - 13 tasks

Then collaborate on US4, US5, US6, testing, and polish.
