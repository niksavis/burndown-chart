# Specification Quality Checklist: JQL Query Enhancements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [001-add-jql-query/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS**: Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. No frameworks, languages, or technical implementation details mentioned. All content is written for non-technical stakeholders.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS**: All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) are measurable and technology-agnostic. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS**: Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Edge cases are documented. Dependencies and assumptions are explicitly listed.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All quality gates passed on first validation
- **Updated 2025-10-15**: Expanded scope to include feature parity between main JQL textarea and save dialog textarea
  - Character count now applies to BOTH locations
  - Syntax highlighting now applies to BOTH locations
  - Ensures consistent UX across all query editing contexts
- No clarifications needed - requirements are clear and actionable
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` command
