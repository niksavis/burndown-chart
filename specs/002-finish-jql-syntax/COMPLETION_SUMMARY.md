   - Performance guarantees documented (<50ms, 60fps)
   - Error handling contracts specified
   - Component lifecycle defined

4. **quickstart.md** (Phase 1) - Developer implementation guide
   - 5-step TDD workflow documented
   - 8 key files identified (2 new, 3 modified)
   - 20+ code examples provided
   - Testing strategy with exact commands

5. **plan.md** (This file) - Implementation plan with constitution validation
   - All constitutional gates passed ✅
   - Technical context specified
   - Project structure defined
   - No complexity violations

### Key Decisions Summary

| Decision Area       | Chosen Approach                                              | Key Benefit                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**    | Dual-layer textarea (transparent input over highlighted div) | Preserves native mobile keyboard, accessibility |
| **Performance**     | requestAnimationFrame throttling                             | Guarantees 60fps, <50ms latency                 |
| **ScriptRunner**    | 15 core functions with extensibility                         | 90%+ use case coverage, maintainable            |
| **Error Detection** | Visual styling (underline + background)                      | Subtle, accessible, non-intrusive               |
| **Browser Support** | Modern browsers only (graceful degradation)                  | Simplified implementation, no polyfills         |
| **Testing**         | TDD with Playwright for integration                          | Reliable, fast, modern browser automation       |

### Implementation Readiness Checklist

- [x] All constitutional gates passed (Pre-Implementation + Post-Design)
- [x] Technical unknowns resolved via research
- [x] Data model defined with validation rules
- [x] API contracts specified with performance guarantees
- [x] Test strategy documented (TDD workflow)
- [x] Development workflow documented (quickstart guide)
- [x] Performance targets validated (benchmarking plan)
- [x] Browser compatibility strategy defined
- [x] Accessibility requirements specified
- [x] Mobile-first approach confirmed
- [x] Backward compatibility verified (feature 001)
- [x] Agent context updated (copilot-instructions.md)

### Estimated Implementation Effort

**Total Lines of Code**: ~550 lines
- Python: ~100 lines (ui/jql_syntax_highlighter.py + modifications)
- JavaScript: ~150 lines (assets/jql_syntax.js)
- CSS: ~100 lines (assets/jql_syntax.css)
- Tests: ~300 lines (unit + integration)

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days (following TDD workflow)
- Day 1: Component structure + unit tests (P1 - User Story 1)
- Day 2: JavaScript synchronization + integration tests (P1 - User Story 1)
- Day 3: ScriptRunner support + error detection (P2, P3 - User Stories 2, 3)

**Risk Level**: LOW
- Reusing proven parsing functions from feature 001
- Well-defined architecture with research validation
- Clear performance requirements with benchmarking plan
- Comprehensive test strategy (TDD + Playwright)
- Graceful degradation ensures no blocking issues

### Next Steps

**Immediate**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks
- Command will create `tasks.md` with detailed task breakdown
- Tasks will follow TDD workflow (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Each task maps to acceptance criteria from spec.md

**After Tasks Generation**:
1. Review task breakdown and estimates
2. Begin implementation following TDD cycle
3. Run tests continuously (pytest + Playwright)
4. Performance profiling after each major milestone
5. Mobile testing on real devices (iOS/Android)
6. Accessibility validation (NVDA screen reader)
7. Browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
8. Code review and merge to main

**Success Criteria for Feature Completion**:
- All 15 acceptance scenarios pass ✅
- Performance targets met (<50ms, 60fps, <300ms paste)
- Mobile viewport testing complete (320px+)
- Accessibility validation complete (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Browser compatibility verified (latest 6 months)
- Zero console errors or warnings
- Backward compatibility with feature 001 verified
