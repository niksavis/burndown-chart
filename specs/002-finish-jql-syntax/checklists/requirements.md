- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on WHAT (visual overlay, highlighting colors) not HOW (specific JavaScript libraries, React components). The "Proposed Solution" section mentions technical approaches but is marked optional and high-level.

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates the user's need and the value delivered. The Problem Statement explains why users need this feature.

✅ **Non-technical language**: The spec uses terminology accessible to product managers and stakeholders ("visual feedback", "real-time highlighting", "error prevention").

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria sections are fully populated with concrete details.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarifications needed**: All functional requirements are specific and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be validated with specific tests:
- FR-001: Verify overlay renders and synchronizes
- FR-002-004: Verify specific colors applied to specific syntax elements
- FR-005: Measure latency from keystroke to highlight update
- FR-006: Test cursor position after highlight updates
- FR-007-008: Test with ScriptRunner syntax examples
- FR-009-010: Test with invalid syntax examples
- FR-011: Performance test with 5000-char queries
- FR-012: Code review to verify existing functions used
- FR-013: Test on mobile devices
- FR-014: Test with mixed-case keywords

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: 50ms latency threshold
- SC-002: Zero dropped keystrokes at 100 WPM
- SC-003: 95% error detection rate
- SC-005: Specific device (iPhone SE, 320px)
- SC-007: 300ms render time for 1000+ chars

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes (timing, visual feedback, error detection) without mentioning specific technologies.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of 3 user stories has 2-5 specific given/when/then scenarios that can be validated.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 7 edge cases documented covering performance, unicode, rapid typing, partial keywords, text selection, whitespace, and mobile interactions.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes auto-completion, validation, query execution, multi-cursor, undo/redo, dark mode, enhanced accessibility, and i18n.

✅ **Dependencies identified**: Dependencies section lists existing feature 001, CSS framework, browser APIs, and ScriptRunner documentation.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to specific acceptance scenarios in user stories. All requirements are verifiable through automated or manual testing.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: User stories cover the complete journey from typing (P1), to advanced syntax (P2), to error prevention (P3). Each story is independently testable.

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 7 success criteria provide clear metrics for feature completion, all focused on user experience (latency, performance, error detection).

✅ **No implementation leaks**: The spec maintains abstraction - focuses on colors, timing, visual indicators rather than specific frameworks or architecture choices.

## Notes

**Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete with no clarifications needed
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Measurable with specific success metrics
- Scoped appropriately with dependencies and out-of-scope items documented
- Technology-agnostic focusing on user value

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to break down into implementation tasks
2. Verify ScriptRunner keyword list is comprehensive (may need research)
3. Consider performance testing infrastructure for SC-001, SC-002, SC-007 metrics
