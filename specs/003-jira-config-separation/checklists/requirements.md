# Specification Quality Checklist: JIRA Configuration Separation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1: October 21, 2025

**Status**: ✅ All checks passed

**Analysis**:

1. **Content Quality**: 
   - Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of React, Python, databases)
   - Focused on user needs: simplified configuration workflow, one-time setup
   - Written in business-friendly language with clear user scenarios
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are fully specified
   - All 18 functional requirements are testable with clear expected behaviors
   - Success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users complete configuration in under 3 minutes" vs "API responds in 200ms")
   - Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with specific conditions
   - Edge cases cover boundary conditions (invalid URLs, token expiration, extreme values)
   - Scope is clearly bounded: focuses on configuration separation, not new JIRA features
   - Dependencies identified implicitly (existing JQL query system, JIRA API access)

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios
   - Three user stories cover complete workflow: initial setup → modification → daily use
   - All 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
   - No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (optional) or `/speckit.plan`
- No issues requiring spec updates
- Feature scope is well-defined and independently testable
